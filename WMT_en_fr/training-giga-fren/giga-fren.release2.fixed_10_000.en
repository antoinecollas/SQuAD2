Astronomers Introduction Introduction video What is Astronomy?
Often considered the oldest science, it was born of our amazement at the sky and our need to question Astronomy is the science of space beyond Earth’s atmosphere.
The name is derived from the Greek root astron for star, and nomos for arrangement or law.
Astronomy is concerned with celestial objects and phenomena – like stars, planets, comets and galaxies – as well as the large-scale properties of the Universe, also known as "The Big Picture".
More specifically, astronomy is the study of the origin and evolution of the Universe, the physics and chemistry of celestial objects, and the calculation of their positions and motions.
For most people, astronomy represents a world that is both mysterious and grandiose – a story about glimmering celestial objects and the immensity of the cosmos.
It prompts us to ask the deepest existential questions:
Who are we?
Where did we come from?
Are we alone?
The lure of these universal enigmas was the spark that ignited the passion of many of today’s famous astronomers.
Astronomy also plays a much more practical role that is not nearly as important today as it was in the past.
Since the time of our earliest ancestors, humans have used the motions of celestial objects to position themselves in space and time.
Prehistoric humans studied the relationship between the seasons and the length of days to plan their hunting and gathering activities.
It was also by observing the positions of the stars that the first farmers decided when to plant and when to harvest, and early navigators could sail the oceans blue.
In the Age of Antiquity, astrometry – the measurement of the positions of stars and planets – was the main occupation of astronomers.
There was some degree of interest for astronomy from the general public as well, since they believed that the positions of celestial objects influenced events that took place on Earth.
 During the Renaissance, advances in mathematics coupled with the invention of new observational instruments (like the refracting telescope) gave rise to modern astronomy.
From the 19th century onwards, the discovery of the electromagnetic spectrum and the world of the atom spurred on the development of astrophysics, a new discipline in astronomy that is now considered to be the most important.
Today, astronomy covers several disciplines:
◦ Astrometry, which is the precise measurement of the position of stars and planets, and which is greatly facilitated by the use of modern CCD cameras and computers
◦ Stellar astronomy, which is the study of the origins and evolution of stars
◦ Galactic astronomy, which studies the structure and components of galaxies
◦ Astrophysics, which studies the Universe and the physics of its constituents (luminosity, temperature, chemical composition)
◦ Cosmology, which studies the origin and evolution of the Universe as a whole Related to these fields of research are two disciplines that lie more within the domain of geologists and biologists: planetary science, which is the study of asteroids, comets and planets, and astrobiology, which studies the possibility of life in the Universe.
Nowadays, professional astronomers have a strong background in astrophysics and their observations are almost always examined in an astrophysical context.
The most serious amateurs actively participate in the study of variable stars, the discovery of new asteroids or comets, and other exciting astronomical work.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The first astronomical observations in Canada The era of explorers and Jesuits The history of Canadian astronomy began when the first European explorers used astronomical observations to guide them over the ocean and to navigate our waterways.
John Cabot, who discovered Newfoundland in 1497, and Jacques Cartier, who explored further inland by way of the Saint-Lawrence River in 1534, were undoubtedly the first explorers that used astronomical instruments to locate the landmass now known as Canada.
It was also during the Champlain era that French missionaries, the Jesuits, first set foot on Canadian soil in 1604.
By 1618, they had begun to record astronomical observations (most notably about comets and eclipses) and included them in the reports sent back to France (titled Relations in French).
In 1634, astronomy officially became a part of the tasks assigned to Jean Bourdon, the Engineer-in-Chief and Land Surveyor for the New France colony in Quebec.
During the time of the early settlers, the function of astronomy was primarily practical.
It was the science of colonization par excellence, used to draw up accurate geographic maps and to tell time precisely.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The first observatories The first astronomical observatory in North America was Canadian It is difficult to confirm with certainty the very first astronomical observatory in Canada.
The Jesuit priest Joseph-Pierre de Bonnécamps, who taught at the College of Quebec from 1750 to 1759, had obtained a number of astronomical instruments with the intention of constructing an observatory on the college roof.
Bonnécamps left Canada in 1759 not long before the fall of Quebec at the hands of the British, and he never returned.
The British closed the College of Quebec and the teaching tasks were transferred to the Seminary of Quebec across the street.
There is mention of an "observation chamber" in the Seminary archives of 1770, which may be a reference to the existence of an astronomical observatory.
Evidence for another early observatory can be found in a wood engraving from a book by the Marquis de Chabert de Cogolin that dates from the time he was at the Fortress of Louisbourg (1750-1751).
Chabert owned several such instruments and it is likely that a temporary observatory existed for a short time in the fortress.
The first North American observatory that existed with historical certainty was at Castle Frederick, the estate founded by Joseph DesBarres at Falmouth, Nova Scotia, in 1765.
Later records describe an observatory on Quebec’s Île Jésus (now "Laval") that was established by Dr. Charles Smallwood de Saint-Martin.
Historical evidence suggests that it was already in existence by 1846.
There is also evidence that in 1849, Dr. James Toldervy of Fredericton, New Brunswick, created an observatory in his garden near the Saint John River.
A year later, in 1850, the Quebec City Observatory was established on the Plains of Abraham.
Built in such a way as to be visible from the port and the Saint Lawrence River, the structure included a large ball that signalled midday when it dropped.
Historical records report the establishment of seven other major observatories from 1850 to the end of the century.
They are: 1.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Observatory The first government observatory and provider of official time in Canada The Dominion Observatory was founded in 1905 in Ottawa, Ontario.
The impetus for Canada’s first government observatory came from the Geological Survey of Canada, which had a pressing need for a service that could supply precise temporal and spatial coordinates for its mapping and topographic surveys.
In those days, only observatories were capable of providing such a service.
William Frederick King, Chief Astronomer for the Department of the Interior, played a key role in setting up the new observatory.
He became its first Director and equipped it with a 35-centimetre telescope, the largest ever installed in Canada.
The first mandate of the observatory was to determine and distribute the exact time to the rest of the country.
King confided this task to Robert Meldrum Stewart, the astronomer who went on to become Director from 1923 to 1946.
More specifically, it was necessary to know the exact moment when certain stars passed their highest point in the sky (the meridian); these were known as "transit times".
Due to the conscientious observation of transit times for many stars, and to the acquisition of a high precision clock in 1929, Stewart gradually established a network of clocks throughout Ottawa’s federal government buildings.
A signal from the observatory’s clock was electronically transmitted to the buildings; in this way, about 700 clocks in Ottawa were able to display precise time by 1930.
After 1941, this time service was extended to the entire country and the Dominion Observatory became the official supplier of time for Canada.
In order to fulfill its second mandate – to provide spatial coordinates for the country – the Dominion Observatory set out to determine the precise position of 3,162 stars in the sky.
This was accomplished by recording 28,000 astronomical observations from 1911 to 1923.
A new project was launched in 1923, and the positions of another 1,368 stars were measured until 1950.
These data – combined with the knowledge of exact time – allowed longitude, latitude and elevation to be calculated with precision for many points across Canada.
As part of its responsibility to the Geological Survey of Canada, the Dominion Observatory was also entrusted with a third mandate: to collect seismic, gravimetric and magnetic geophysical data.
Among the noteworthy events that marked the history of the Dominion Observatory were the apparent discovery of "Planet X" in 1928, the determination of the solar rotation as a function of latitude in the 1930’s, and the discovery of numerous meteor impact sites in Canada.
Scientific institutions in Canada were reorganized in 1970 and the responsibilities of the Dominion Observatory were transferred to the National Research Council of Canada (NRC).
The observatory ceased its activities and the building became the headquarters for the NRC.
In 1974, the telescope was moved to the Helen Sawyer Hogg Observatory of the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology where it remains to this day.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory The first Canadian observatory of international calibre, it once housed the largest telescope in the world The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1918 at Saanich near Victoria, British Columbia.
Its creation was motivated by the growing need of Canadian astronomers to have access to a large world-class telescope.
The observatory immediately achieved international status by housing a 1.83-metre telescope that was the largest operating telescope in the world, although it only held this title for a few months.
The installation of the telescope was largely the work of celebrated Canadian astronomer John Stanley Plaskett, and the instrument was baptized the "Plaskett Telescope" in his honour.
It measured 15 metres long and its mobile parts weighed 42 tonnes.
Plaskett became the first Director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and helped it establish an international research reputation very early on.
In 1922, for example, he discovered a binary star and the larger of the two still holds the record as the most massive known binary star.
This celestial body bears the name of "Plaskett’s Star" in his honour.
During subsequent years, Plaskett established the radial velocities of several stars (that is, the speed at which the stars are moving away or toward the observer) and demonstrated that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is rotating.
He was also the first to measure the size, mass and rotational speed of the Milky Way.
He also established that the Sun is located at 2/3 the distance from the centre of our galaxy to its edge, and that our solar system takes approximately 22 million years to complete one galaxial rotation.
In 1940, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory was the site of two other major discoveries.
Andrew McKellar, one of the observatory’s astronomers, became the first researcher to detect the presence of matter in interstellar space when he identified the spectral bands for the organic compounds cyanogen ("CN") and methyne ("CH").
One year later, in 1941, he determined the temperature of the cyanogen molecules and deduced that the interstellar environment in which they are found is very cold, approximately -270 °C.
It was the first direct measurement of the temperature of the Universe.
In 1962, the observatory acquired a second telescope measuring 1.22 metres in diameter.
Equipped with only a spectroscope, it was mainly used to study binary stars.
In 1970, the responsibility of the observatory was conferred to the National Research Council of Canada.
In 1981, the observatory received a third telescope measuring 40 centimetres across.
It was primarily used for scientific research, notably the study of gas clouds in our galaxy (the Milky Way), and to test instruments destined for large telescopes.
Today it is used to show the sky to the general public.
In 1995, the observatory became the headquarters for the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, which operates several telescopes (optical and radio) in Canada and shares many others with various countries elsewhere in the world, including the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Gemini telescopes.
In 2001, the observatory inaugurated an interpretation centre open to the general public all year long and affectionately named "The Centre of the Universe".
It includes a small planetarium and offers interactive displays, multimedia presentations and special events designed to introduce people from all walks of life to the world of astronomy.
Over the years, new instruments were added and many technical improvements were made to the Plaskett Telescope, the observatory’s main telescope.
Today, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory is the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The David Dunlap Observatory Home to the largest optical telescope in Canada The David Dunlap Observatory opened its doors in 1935 near the small town of Richmond Hill, 25 kilometres north of Toronto, Ontario.
The facility was the property of the University of Toronto and was operated by the astronomy department.
It was created to conduct astronomical research, to assist in the advanced education of university students, and to stimulate the public’s interest in astronomy.
The observatory was mainly the work of Clarence Augustus Chant, a Canadian astronomer and astronomy professor at the University of Toronto.
In 1921, while campaigning to establish a large telescope observatory in the Toronto region, Chant managed to get David Dunlap, a lawyer and mining entrepreneur, interested in the project.
Unfortunately, Dunlap died in 1924, but his widow, Jessie, took up the cause and worked for the next ten years with Chant to make sure the project succeeded.
The observatory was inaugurated the same day that Chant celebrated his 70th birthday, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Toronto, and took his retirement.
At the time of its inauguration, the observatory housed a 1.88-metre telescope, the second largest in the world after the Mount Wilson telescope in the United States, and Canada thus owned two of the four largest telescopes in the world.
The building that houses the administrative offices of the observatory was also inaugurated in 1935.
Over the years, more and more radio astronomers were joining the astronomy department at the University of Toronto, and in the 1960’s, the David Dunlap Observatory actively participated in the development of the Algonquin Radio Observatory in Ontario.
By the end of the 1960’s, the David Dunlap Observatory, being located near the major urban centre of Toronto, found itself plagued with the problem of light pollution.
The observatory responded in 1971 by erecting a 60-centimetre telescope at Las Campanas in Chile.
The David Dunlap Observatory thus acquired international status and the skies of the south were available to Canadian astronomers for the first time.
A spectacular discovery was made at the David Dunlap Observatory in 1972.
Charles Thomas Bolton, one of the observatory’s astronomers, discovered Cygnus X-1, the first black hole ever identified.
In 1987, the observatory was responsible for another amazing discovery thanks to its telescope in Las Campanas.
Ian Shelton, one of the astronomers from the University of Toronto, was using the Chilean telescope when he observed a supernova (1987 A) in the Greater Magellan could.
The discovery made headlines around the world, as it was the first supernova visible to the unaided eye in almost 400 years.
Unfortunately, financial problems forced the David Dunlap Observatory to cease operations at Las Campanas in 1997.
The National Observatory of Argentina took charge of the telescope and moved it from Chile to Parque El Leoncito in Argentina.
The David Dunlap Observatory nonetheless retains one quarter of the observation time at the telescope.
Today, the David Dunlap Observatory of Toronto is still active thanks in part to a light pollution abatement program initiated by Charles Thomas Bolton.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Algonquin Radio Observatory Home to the largest parabolic antenna in Canada The Algonquin Radio Observatory was inaugurated in 1959 at Traverse Lake in the Algonquin National Park in Ontario.
It was created by the National Research Council of Canada for Canadian radio astronomers who needed a site in Ontario where radio interference would be minimal.
The first director was Arthur Edwin Covington, Canada’s first radio astronomer.
More than a decade earlier, in 1946, Covington had collected data on the Sun’s radio flux (the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths) from a site in Ottawa, and again in 1947 from Goth Hill south of Ottawa.
His work became of paramount importance when he demonstrated that the intensity of solar radiation was related to the Sun’s magnetic activity, which had (and still has) crucial implications for numerous human activities, such as communications systems and power lines.
The Traverse Lake site in Algonquin National Park was selected for the Algonquin Radio Observatory due to its relative isolation from manmade interference.
Covington installed a parabolic mirror with a diameter of 1.83 metres in 1960 and began moving his equipment from Goth Hill in 1962.
The radio telescopes operated continuously at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres, which is an ideal wavelength for monitoring solar activity due to the Sun’s particular chemical composition.
In 1966, an array consisting of 32 parabolic antennas, each 3 metres in diameter, was added to the observatory.
The goal was to refine the measurements from other radio telescopes by scanning the Sun’s surface every noon at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres.
Operating at a wavelength of 2 centimetres, it was used to study galactic and extragalactic objects that emit radio waves, such as quasars.
In 1968, the 46-metre radio telescope was used in conjunction with the 26-metre instrument at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory of Penticton, British Columbia, to simulate the resolution of a giant 3,074-kilometre radio telescope (the physical distance separating the two instruments).
It was the first successful long distance interferometry experiment ever conducted.
The goal of the experiment was to discern a source of radio waves with great precision.
Very large antennas are necessary to precisely determine the position of radio sources because radio waves have much larger wavelengths than visible light waves, and because the detection of any object in space depends largely on the size of the observation instrument (that is, its lenses, mirrors or radio antennas).
The 1970’s marked a time of increased collaboration between the Algonquin Observatory radio astronomers and the researchers at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Many new complex chemical compounds were identified for the first time in interstellar gas clouds thanks to the collaborative effort.
After planning to resurface the 46-metre radio telescope so that it could operate at wavelengths as small as 3 millimetres, the National Research Council of Canada decided instead to close the Algonquin Observatory in 1987 and purchase a 25% share in the new James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory, which would include a radio telescope that could operate at 0.3 to 2 millimetres.
In 1990, the work of collecting data on the Sun’s radio flux moved to the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia.
In 1991, the Algonquin Radio Observatory was finally closed, but the 46-metre antenna is nonetheless still active as part of a continental network of antennas that precisely measures movements of the North American tectonic plate.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory The largest radio astronomy observatory in Canada The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1960 at White Lake near Penticton, British Columbia.
The creation of the observatory was primarily the work of Carlyle Smith Beals, an astronomer who wanted to advance the field of astrophysics in Canada.
The first parabolic antenna, measuring 25.6 metres, began operating in 1960.
It was mainly designed to operate at a wavelength of 21 centimetres, which corresponds to one of the spectral lines of hydrogen.
Radio astronomers at Penticton have been striving towards this goal since the first days of the observatory.
In 1962, a second radio telescope was put in place.
Fully operational in 1964, it consisted of 1,700 cedar posts that extended for 1.3 kilometres in the shape of a "T" to cover a surface area of 65,000 square metres.
The posts supported a network of several thousand metres of metallic wires formed the antenna of the radio telescope.
This radio telescope was primarily used between 1965 and 1969 during a period when solar spots were at a minimum.
In fact, it is only during these periods of low solar activity that very long radio waves from space can pass through the atmosphere to reach Earth’s surface.
The main goal of the T-shaped radio telescope at Penticton was to produce a map of radio sources in our galaxy.
It was also used to observe several hundred specific radio sources, such as quasars and distant galaxies.
In 1965, a 1.8-metre parabolic antenna was installed to collect data on solar radiation.
In 1968, the 25.6-metre radio telescope at Penticton was used in conjunction with the 46-metre telescope at the Algonquin Radio Observatory to simulate the resolution of a giant radio telescope measuring 3,074 kilometres (the physical distance between the two instruments).
The antennas would operate at a wavelength of 21 centimetres, which corresponds to one of the spectral lines of hydrogen.
Today, the synthesis array radio telescope consists of seven 8.5-metre parabolic antennas that can operate continuously, 24 hours a day, at two wavelengths (21 and 74 centimetres).
From 1995 to 2005, the radio telescope was mainly used in the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, the goal of which is to map a large portion of the Milky Way.
In 1990, following the closure of the Algonquin Radio Observatory, the task of gathering data on the Sun’s radio flux (the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths) was transferred to the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory at Penticton.
The observatory is now under the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory An example of a successful partnership The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1972 at Priddis, a small locality 75 kilometres southwest of Calgary, Alberta.
Belonging to the University of Calgary, the facility was operated by the astronomy and physics departments.
The objectives the observatory were the advanced education of university students and the pursuit of astronomical research.
In 1970, Alexander Rothney Cross, a wealthy rancher, donated land to the University of Calgary for the purpose of constructing the observatory.
Work commenced in 1971 and the university took the opportunity to simultaneously start an undergraduate degree in astronomy.
The observatory opened its doors in 1972 to display a dome housing a 41-centimetre telescope, and an adjacent lecture room.
The first research activities were mostly on photometry.
The year of 1981 was particularly fruitful for the observatory.
The National Research Council of Canada decided to finance the construction of a new facility that would house a 1.5-metre telescope capable of operating in the infrared range.
Alexander Rothney Cross signed on to the project by making another donation.
The Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake also provided a gift: a Baker-Nunn camera that the Armed Forces had used to track satellites in the sky.
The new facility was constructed by the physics department of the University of Calgary.
Construction continued for several years and by 1987 the 1.5-metre telescope was operational.
The physics department changed its name to the Department of Physics and Astronomy.
Most of the research work focused on the study of stars, X-ray sources, possible black holes and planetary nebulas.
The telescope was still equipped with a metal mirror (not glass), and its optical qualities were considered less than optimal by that time.
The decision was made at the end of the 1980’s to replace it with a new 1.8-metre mirror.
The new mirror was delivered to the observatory in 1993, and once again, Alexander Rothney Cross contributed to the project.
Construction was completed by the workshop of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and the telescope became operational in 1996.
The following year, it was baptized as the Alexander Rothney Cross Telescope in honour of the generous benefactor.
The new telescope is used to observe (among other things) gravitational lenses, asteroids, comets and variable stars, and is also used in the search for planets outside our solar system.
Recent developments include a new Visitor’s Centre that was inaugurated in 2003.
The 41-centimetre telescope continues to be operational and is used to track asteroids that orbit near Earth and represent a possible danger.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Mont-Mégantic Observatory The largest astronomical observatory in eastern North America The Mont-Mégantic Observatory was opened in 1978 near Sherbrooke, Quebec.
It was created to promote university-level astronomy education in Quebec, to provide qualified astronomers with state of the art research equipment, and to promote astronomy among French Canadian citizens.
The telescope is equipped with a 1.6-metre mirror that weights one metric ton; the entire structure weighs 24 tonnes.
The Mont-Mégantic Observatory houses the largest telescope in eastern North America, and the fourth largest in Canada after those of the David Dunlap Observatory in Toronto (1.88 metres), the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria (1.83 metres), and the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (1.8 metres).
Although not the biggest, the state of the art instruments attached to the Mont-Mégantic telescope make it the most powerful telescope in Canada.
The project to construct a large observatory in Quebec was launched in 1971 by professors Gilles Beaudet and George Michaud of the University of Montreal.
Laval University in Quebec City joined the venture in 1974 and a partnership agreement was signed in 1975.
The federal and provincial governments approved the project in 1976, and construction started the same year.
The service building was completed in 1977, and the observatory several months later in 1978.
René Racine joined the project in 1973 and became Director in 1976, the same year he left the University of Toronto to work at the University of Montreal.
A dynamic instrument program also accounts for a large part of Mégantic’s productivity.
In 1991, for example, the observatory became the first in Canada to use an infrared camera.
Named MONICA (for MONtreal Infrared Camera), it was designed by Daniel Nadeau and René Doyon of the University of Montreal.
The site at Mont-Mégantic is particularly favourable for infrared astronomy because interference radiation levels are very low during the long cold nights in winter (sometimes even lower than the levels at Mauna Kea in Hawaii).
In 1996, the Mont-Mégantic ASTROLab, an astronomy activity centre, opened its doors to the general public.
The centre hosts interactive displays, a high definition movie, multimedia presentations and access to two public observatories during open house astronomy evenings.
Visitors can also tour the observatory and its 1.6-metre telescope during the day.
In 1999, a major 3-year renovation program was started.
First, the dome of the 1.6-metre telescope was repaired and equipped with a ventilation system.
Then, in 2000, the observatory was linked to universities by fibre optics.
A year later, the telescope controls became fully computerized and a new bonnet (the interface that allows instruments to be coupled to the telescope) was installed.
Following this, a number of new state of the art instruments were also added to the telescope.
Asteroid 4843 is named in honour of the observatory.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory One of the most powerful and productive observatories in the world The Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory began operating in 1979 atop the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.
Canada’s participation meant valuable access to a world-class telescope for Canadian astronomers.
At the time of its inauguration, the 3.6-metre telescope was the sixth largest in the world and operated in the range of visible light and infrared.
France launched the project in 1970 with the purchase of a 14-tonne glass disk.
The state of Hawaii joined the project in 1971, followed by Canada in 1973.
The three partners signed an agreement in 1974 and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation was born.
Canada was in charge of polishing the mirror, putting into place a control system for the telescope, and constructing the observatory building.
France was responsible for constructing specific mechanical parts for the telescope (tube, frame, etc.), and Hawaii provided the site, a road to the site, and several instruments.
The telescope’s mobile component weighed 250 tonnes and the total structure weighed 325 tonnes.
In 1977, the headquarters and a library were set up at Waimea near the observatory.
Canada was granted access to 42.5% of the available observation time, France 42.5%, and the United States 15%.
In 1996, an adaptive optics system was installed on the telescope that would once again rival the Hubble Space Telescope in the production of the highest resolution astronomical images.
These new improvements quickly bore fruit for the Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory as it was involved in discovering – or confirming the discovery of – many new moons, gravitational lenses, and so on.
For example, astronomers Brett J. Gladman and John J. Kavelaars discovered three new satellites around the planet Uranus in 1999 (Prospero, Setebos, and Stephano) and eight around Saturn in 2000 (Siarnaq, Tarvos, Ijrak, Thrymr, Skathi, Mundilfari, Erriapo and Suttungr).
The discoveries of other moons around Uranus and Neptune were announced in 2001 and 2002, but have not yet been confirmed.
In 2003, a new imaging system known as MegaPrime was installed.
MegaPrime uses the French-designed MegaCam camera that is able to take 340-million pixel images (about 18,400 x 18,400 pixels), making it the most powerful camera of its type in the world.
These days, the observatory is involved in the study of the solar system, the birth and evolution of stars, the interstellar medium, the structure and content of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and large-scale structures of the Universe.
The Canadian participation in the observatory is managed by the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory The largest submillimetre radio telescope in the world The James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory was inaugurated in 1987 near the summit of Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.
The observatory is named after James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist who was famous for his groundbreaking work in electricity and magnetism.
At the time of the observatory’s construction, the National Research Council of Canada was planning to resurface its 46-metre radio telescope at the Algonquin Radio Astronomy Observatory.
The goal of the resurfacing program was to increase the resolution of the telescope so that it could observe wavelengths as small as three millimetres.
Upon learning of the capabilities of the new British-Dutch radio telescope, the Council decided instead to close the Algonquin Observatory in 1987and to purchase a 25% share in the James-Clerk-Maxwell Telescope.
The JCMT would suit the needs of Canadian astronomers because it was to operate at wavelengths in the submillimetre to lower microwave range (between 0.3 to 2 millimetres).
Canada currently has access to 22.5% of observation time, the United Kingdom 49.5%, the Netherlands 18%, and the international community 10%.
A piece of Gore-TexTM (the largest in the world) is permanently attached to the building’s opening, which protects the telescope from wind and dust but still allows it to "see" the sky.
Gore-Tex allows 97% of submillimetre waves to pass through and does not interfere with the operation of the radio telescope.
The number one enemy of a radio telescope is water vapour in the Earth’s atmosphere because it easily absorbs submillimetre waves.
To minimize this effect, the observatory is located at an elevation of 4,092 metres: 97% of atmospheric water vapour exists below this elevation and thus below the observatory.
The main use of radio telescopes is to study our solar system (the Sun, planets and comets), interstellar matter, distant galaxies, quasars, and cosmic background radiation.
The government organization responsible for Canadian participation in the radio telescope is the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory Perfecting the next generation of super telescopes The University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory was established in 1995 at Maple Ridge, approximately 60 kilometres east of Vancouver.
The goal of the observatory is to develop and test new liquid mirror telescopes.
Liquid mirror telescopes are part of the next generation of super telescopes.
A liquid mirror is made of a strongly reflective liquid (like mercury, for example) that rotates so that its surface curves and takes the shape of a paraboloid, which will direct and concentrate light to the focal point of a telescope.
This type of mirror has a major advantage over conventional mirrors in that it is much cheaper to build (up to 100 times less expensive).
In 1982, Ermanno Franco Borra, a professor in the Physics Department at Laval University in Quebec, revived the historical proposal of creating liquid mirror telescopes and sought to demonstrate the feasibility of such a project.
Several liquid mirrors were subsequently developed at Laval University in the 1980’s.
In 1994, Paul Hickson of the University of British-Columbia completed the construction of the first liquid mirror telescope in collaboration with Borra.
The mirror measured 2.64 metres in diameter.
The following year, Hickson installed his telescope in the newly inaugurated University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory.
The efforts of Hickson and his collaborators culminated in 2004 when the 6-metre liquid mirror Large Zenith Telescope went into operation.
The Large Zenith Telescope is the third largest optical telescope in North America and the largest liquid mirror telescope in the world.
Despite its enormous size, the mirror components weigh only 3 tonnes.
At the present time, the observatory is involved in two large-scale projects.
The first is the construction of the ALPACA telescope (Advanced Liquid-mirror Probe for Astrophysics, Cosmology and Asteroids), which consists of a liquid mirror measuring 8 metres in diameter.
The array will simulate a telescope measuring 50 metres in diameter.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Gemini North and South Observatory A pair of giant observatories – one in each hemisphere – to provide full sky coverage As the name would suggest, Gemini (which means "twins" in Latin) is the name given to two astronomical observatories.
The locations of these two observatories provide complete access to the sky from both hemispheres.
The idea to construct the two observatories arose in the mid-1980’s.
The venture really got going in 1990 when an agreement was signed between the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
Observation time is distributed in these same proportions.
Gemini North saw first light in 1999, whereas Gemini South opened a year later in 2000.
The instruments on each telescope, however, are not necessarily the same (cameras, spectrometers, etc.). One of the main contributions made by Canada was to provide an adaptive optics system: a system that corrects image distortion due to turbulence in Earth’s atmosphere.
The construction of the dome, the support, the subterranean facilities and the system that controls the rotating part of each telescope was also Canada’s responsibility.
The system consists of 120 hydraulic jacks under the mirror that provide constant adjustments to restore it to a perfect shape.
The adjustments are typically on the order of one thousandth the width of a human hair.
The observatories were specifically designed to observe visible light, but also infrared light.
Clouds of gas and dust hide large sectors of space, like the regions where stars and planets are forming, or the cores of galaxies that contain quasars and black holes.
Infrared light is of great interest to astronomers because it is able to penetrate these clouds and reveal details that would otherwise be invisible.
The reflecting surface of the Gemini mirrors is made of a thin film of silver that reflects infrared rays better than aluminum, and the domes of the observatories are a metallic grey colour instead of the traditional white to keep the temperature of the telescopes constant.
Moving hatches allow the observing slits to open across the entire dome.
All these finishing touches make the Gemini telescopes expensive instruments to operate.
It currently costs about $50,000 for a single night of observation at one of the telescopes.
Astronomers, however, do not have to spend this amount themselves: user fees for a Gemini telescope are paid by the national agencies that finance the observatory.
Canadian participation in the Gemini telescopes is currently the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics   Video sequence   Jean-René Roy talks about the Gemini telescopes.
The satellite, which weighs 1,360 kilograms, was designed to last three years.
It was the result of a collaborative effort between the United States, Canada and France.
John Hutchings, an astronomer from the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, is Canada’s project scientist.
As the name would suggest, FUSE is an observatory with a mission to study distant sources of ultraviolet radiation, specifically in the range of 9 to 12 millionths of a centimetre.
This portion of the electromagnetic spectrum has been little studied up to this point, mainly because the ozone layer in Earth’s atmosphere absorbs most of the ultraviolet rays that arrive from space.
Ultraviolet light is also particularly difficult to collect.
It becomes increasingly difficult for a mirror to reflect light at very short wavelengths because the waves tend to "slide" between the atoms of the reflecting surface.
X-rays, which are found immediately after ultraviolet rays in the electromagnetic spectrum, have such short wavelengths that they pass right through objects (of course this is also the very property that makes them so useful in medicine).
The FUSE Space Telescope consists of four mirrors specially designed for reflecting ultraviolet light.
Two mirrors are coated with silicon carbide, whereas the other two are coated with lithium fluoride over aluminum.
The FUSE Observatory is 10,000 times more sensitive than the Copernicus satellite (1972-1981), which was the last satellite to observe the sky in ultraviolet light.
The Canadian contribution consists of two fine guidance sensors that allow the space observatory to be aimed at its targets with a very high degree of precision.
This contribution guarantees Canada at least 5% of the available observation time.
The primary mission for FUSE is to analyse the amount of deuterium ("heavy" hydrogen) in the Universe in order to better understand the activity of stars since the Big Bang.
The amount of deuterium has been continually decreasing since the formation of the Universe as the nuclear processes in stars destroy it.
The observatory is also used for other research projects.
In 2000, for example, the telescope was used to discover an explosion involving thousands of stars has left a colossal halo of burning gas the shape of a football extending up to 5,000 to 10,000 light-years above and below the Milky Way.
The observatory is still functioning today, despite numerous setbacks that can be expected given its advanced age.
Video sequence   John Barrie Hutchings explains what FUSE is.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory The only underground Canadian observatory The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory began operating in 1999 at a depth of 2,070 metres below the surface in the Creighton mine near Sudbury, Ontario.
The goal of the observatory is to detect and study neutrinos emitted by the Sun and other celestial objects.
It is the product of a collaborative effort between Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
Neutrinos are small elementary particles that are electrically neutral (that is, they have no electrical charge).
So little, in fact, that matter is virtually transparent to them, and therein lies the difficulty in detecting neutrinos.
Stars produce large amounts of neutrinos.
The Sun, for example, emits 200 trillion trillion trillion neutrinos each second.
Billions of neutrinos pass through the Sun, the Earth and your body every instant without being hindered.
In fact, during your entire lifetime, only one or two neutrinos will ever come into contact with one of the atoms in your body.
One of the major unresolved problems about our Sun is related to its production of neutrinos.
In the early 1980’s, it was realized that the number of solar neutrinos detected by various laboratories were less than predicted by theoretical calculations.
Two hypotheses were proposed: either that our knowledge of the Sun is insufficient, or that some of the neutrinos change their form during their voyage to the Earth (this phenomenon is known to affect other elementary particles), which would mean that the number of neutrinos reaching Earth is less than the amount originally emitted by the Sun.
In 1983, Canadian researchers proposed the construction of an underground neutrino detector in an Ontario nickel mine belonging to the company Inco.
The underground site would shield the detector from microwaves in the background cosmic radiation, which would normally impede the detection of solar neutrinos.
One year later, in 1984, an American researcher published a study that demonstrated the advantages of using heavy water (water in which the hydrogen atoms each have an extra neutron) as a neutrino detector.
Since Canada has an abundant reserve of heavy water, it was decided that the facility would operate as a heavy water detector.
The United States joined the project, follow by the United Kingdom in 1989.
Work began in 1990 and was completed in 1999.
The detector consists of 1,000 tonnes of ultra pure heavy water enclosed in a transparent plastic vessel measuring 12 metres across.
The vessel is itself enclosed in 7,000 tonnes of ultra pure normal water, lodged in an immense cavity measuring 22 metres wide and 34 metres high (the equivalent of a 10-storey building).
It is the largest underground opening ever excavated at two kilometres depth.
The acrylic vessel is surrounded by a 17-metre geodesic dome equipped with 9,600 detectors that sense the presence of neutrinos.
The frequency of neutrino detection is one per hour.
The results from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory have demonstrated that neutrinos do indeed change their form during their trip from the Sun to the Earth, thus putting an end to the debate.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Cosmic Background Imager An observatory for studying the oldest light ever emitted The Cosmic Background Imager was put into service in 2000 at Llano de Chajnantor, a high plateau in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
It was the result of collaboration between the United States, Canada and Chile.
The Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics is responsible for Canada’s participation in the observatory.
The goal of the Imager is to make a map of the distribution of cosmic background radiation, microwave radiation that represents the aftermath of the Big Bang, the great explosion that gave birth to the Universe.
The Imager is thus studying the oldest light energy ever emitted.
Mapping the distribution of this ancient light – this ancient radiation – effectively allows researchers to "see" what the Universe looked like very shortly after its birth.
This information is extremely important because it helps them better understand the creation, organization and evolution of large structures in the cosmos, such as galaxy clusters.
The observatory’s telescope operates at wavelengths between 0.83 and 1.15 centimetres, which corresponds to the field of microwaves.
It consists of 13 parabolic antennas mounted on a platform measuring six metres in diameter that can be pointed anywhere in the sky.
Each antenna is 90 centimetres across and is lodged in a protective cylinder sealed with a Teflon cover that can transmit microwaves.
In 2002, the telescope detected a pattern in the distribution of background cosmic radiation that revealed structures much smaller than any observed to date.
Researchers also detected a second pattern that could provide new information about the movement of matter shortly after the Big Bang.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Odin Space Observatory An observatory that specializes in research about water and oxygen The Odin Space Observatory was launched into orbit in 2001.
It is a Swedish satellite that was developed in collaboration with Canada, Finland and France; Canada’s contribution is 20%.
It is the first international satellite in which Canada played a major role in design, construction and operation.
The observatory is named after the Norwegian and Germanic god Odin.
Its mission is twofold: the first objective focuses on aeronomy (the study of the atmosphere), and the second on astronomy.
The aeronomic goal is to study certain molecules that are found in Earth’s atmosphere – such as water, chlorine compounds and ozone – which can help us better understand the processes that cause thinning of the ozone layer.
The goal in terms of astronomy is to detect specific molecules in comets, planets, stars, interstellar clouds and galaxies.
The molecules of greatest interest are water and oxygen, because these cannot be studied from Earth’s surface: our atmosphere blocks any radiation emitted by these molecules in space.
All together the satellite weighs 250 kilograms.
Canada’s role in the project began in 1991 when informal discussions began with Sweden about a possible collaboration between the two countries.
An agreement was signed in 1994 that defined Canada’s role and the venture was launched.
Canada provided several instruments, including OSIRIS, which are used to study specific gases and aerosols in Earth’s atmosphere for the aeronomic part of the mission.
The launch was initially planned for 1997, but after several delays and postponements, it finally took place in 2001.
The predicted life expectancy for the observatory was two years (that is, until 2003), but the satellite is still functioning today.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The MOST Space Telescope The first space telescope entirely of Canadian designed and construction The MOST Space Telescope (which stands for Microvariability and Oscillation of Stars) was launched into space in 2003.
There is a great interest for studying stellar vibrations because they allow scientists to obtain information about the internal structure of a star, and thus about its size, mass and composition.
In 1997, the Canadian Space Agency agreed to finance the project and Jaymie Matthews was named Principal Investigator and Mission Scientist.
About the size and shape of a large suitcase, the satellite weighs only 54 kilograms and is equipped with an ultra high precision telescope that measures only 15 centimetres in diameter.
Despite its diminutive size, it is ten times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope in detecting the minuscule variations in a star’s luminosity caused by vibrations that shake its surface.
The telescope will complete one orbit around the Earth every 101 minutes by passing over each of Earth’s poles.
It will spend 60 days on each star studied.
Its predicted life expectancy is 5 to 10 years.
The first major discovery made by the telescope occurred as soon as it became operational.
The discovery was that Procyon, one of the most studied stars, shows no pulsations at all, which contradicts 20 years of ideas and observations, and forced astronomers to rethink their models for stars.
In 2005, MOST was responsible for another surprising discovery: it observed a giant planet that orbits so close to its host star that the star was forced to synchronize its rotation with that of the planet.
Normally, it is the other way around: a planet synchronizes its orbit with that of its host star.
Video sequence  Jaymie Mark Matthews explains what MOST is.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Atacama Large Millimeter Array What will be the largest submillimetre radio telescope in the world The Atacama Large Millimeter Array will be inaugurated in 2011 at Llano de Chajnantor, a high plateau in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
The array should be usable for scientific purposes before its completion, starting in 2007.
The creation of the array is the result of collaboration between Canada, the United States, Europe, Japan and Chile.
The National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics is responsible for Canada’s participation in the radio telescope.
The array consists of 62 parabolic antennas measuring 12 metres across and spread out over 14 kilometres in the desert.
They will operate together to simulate a single radio telescope with a diameter of 14 kilometres.
The antennas will operate at wavelengths between 0.00035 and 10 millimetres: that is, from submillimetre wavelengths to the beginning of the microwave range.
Canada will provide 64 ultra-sensitive receptors for the 3-millimetre wavelength range, as well as the image processing software for the radio telescope.
The Atacama Large Millimeter Array will be used to study the formation of planets, stars, distant galaxies, galaxy clusters and interstellar matter.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The James Webb Space Telescope The successor to the Hubble Space Telescope The James Webb Space Telescope will be launched into space at the beginning of the next decade.
However, it is too far to be repaired and maintained by astronauts, so its life span will only be 5 to 10 years.
The observatory bears the name of James Edwin Webb, director of NASA from 1961 to 1968.
It is the product of a collaborative effort between the United States, Canada and Europe.
John Hutchings, an astronomer with the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, is Canada’s Project Scientist.
At 6.5 metres in diameter, the mirror of the telescope will have a surface seven times greater than that of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope (2.4-metre mirror).
The mirror will consist of 18 small hexagonal mirrors that will deploy and fit together once the telescope is in orbit.
The entire observatory will weigh 6,600 kilograms.
The telescope will operate at wavelengths between 28 thousandths to 6 millionths of a centimetre: that is, from the mid-range of the infrared to almost the beginning of visible red light (Hubble, in contrast, observes at ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared wavelengths).
This range of wavelengths will make it possible to detect extrasolar planets, to conduct detailed studies into the formation of planets and stars, and to study the oldest galaxies lying at the edges of the Universe.
Canadian researchers are also part of the American and European teams in charge of designing other instruments for the space telescope.

The next generation
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers William Frederick King (1854-1916) He raised Canadian astronomy to international stature William Frederick King was born in 1854 at Stowmarket (Suffolk) in England.
His family immigrated to Canada in 1862 and settled down at Port Hope, Ontario.
In 1875, he obtained his bachelor’s degree with high distinctions from the University of Toronto, and he also earned the university’s gold medal in mathematics.
He spent his free time at the university performing complex mathematical calculations for personal amusement.
Later during his career, the University of Toronto awarded him an honorary doctoral degree for his work in astronomy in 1904.
King published many scientific articles on astronomy.
Without doubt, the most significant was his classic article The Geometry of Orbits in which he described a new method for calculating the orbits of binary stars.
The relative obscurity of his scientific career is more than compensated by his famous achievements as astronomer and administrator for the Canadian Government.
It was under his guidance that astronomy really took off in Canada, developing first at the national scale and then rising to international stature.
King entered the Canadian Government as a land surveyor and topographer in 1872 at the age of 18.
He worked on federal lands in western Canada where his knowledge of astronomy was an asset during mapping as it allowed him to determine the longitudes and latitudes of many locations.
He rose step by step through the government echelons until his nomination as Chief Inspector of Surveys for the Department of the Interior in 1886.
In 1887, King began to pressure the government into creating a federal astronomical observatory.
In 1890, he founded the Astronomy Division of the Department of the Interior with the help of Edward Gaston Daniel Deville and Otto Julius Klotz.
He became its first director that same year and built a small wooden observatory on Cliff Street.
King was nominated seven times as Commissioner of the International Boundary Commission between 1892 and 1908, and he thus helped establish the Canadian-American border.
The world longitude network across the Pacific Ocean was also completed under his direction.
In 1908, he was named Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George for his work.
In 1900, he became founding president of the Ottawa Centre for the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, a position he maintained until his death in 1916.
His efforts to create a large and permanent astronomical observatory bore fruit in 1905 with the inauguration of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa.
The observatory was equipped with 38-centimetre astronomical telescope and King became its first director.
In 1909, he succeeded where many before him had tried and failed: he founded the Geodetic Survey Division of Canada and became its first director.
Using a variety of methods, including astronomical measurements, the Division managed to precisely determine the position and elevation of many reference points throughout the country, which greatly assisted in the making of geographic maps.
In 1910, only five years after the creation of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, King was in charge of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory near Victoria, British Columbia, but died before its inauguration.
In 1911, King was elected President of the Royal Society of Canada, the highest scientific distinction in Canada at the time.
He passed away in Ottawa in 1916 at 62 years old.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Stanley Plaskett (1865-1941) He laid the basic foundation for astrophysical research in Canada John Stanley Plaskett was born in 1865 on a farm in Hickson, Ontario.
He began working at the Edison Company (which later become General Electric) in 1886 where he gained experience in mechanics and electricity.
Determined to obtain a university education, he enrolled in the bachelor’s program in 1895 and earned his diploma four years later in 1899 at the age of 33.
Plaskett received four honorary doctoral degrees from Canadian and American universities during his career.
After obtaining his bachelor’s degree, Plaskett taught as a lecturer in the physics department at the University of Toronto.
In 1903, William Frederick King hired him as part of the Astronomy Division of the Department of the Interior to help design and construct instruments for the new Dominion Observatory in Ottawa.
Plaskett became an invaluable addition to the team thanks to his experience in electricity, mechanics and photography.
Plaskett made his first real foray into astronomy in 1905 at the age of 39.
William Frederick King assigned him the responsibility of astrophysical work at the Dominion Observatory.
During his first research project, he was responsible for studying a total eclipse of the Sun that would be visible from Labrador.
In 1907, after working for two years on a new spectroscope of his own design, Plaskett attached it to the telescope of the Dominion Observatory.
He mainly used it to measure the radial velocities of stars (the speed at which the star is moving away or toward the observer), and managed to collect several thousand spectrograms over the following years.
It quickly became evident, however, that the observatory’s 38-centimetre telescope was not efficient enough for the purpose.
In 1910, Plaskett proposed to William Frederick King that a new giant telescope be constructed.
King was enthusiastic about the idea and the two astronomers began pressuring the Canadian Government to make it a reality.
In 1913, Parliament freed up funds and Plaskett worked for the next five years on the design of a 1.83-metre telescope – the biggest in the world – for the new Dominion Astrophysical Observatory to be built in Victoria, British Columbia.
The new observatory was inaugurated in 1918.
Plaskett continued his work on the radial velocities of stars.
In 1922, he discovered a binary star and the larger of the two still holds the record as the most massive known binary star; it is known today as "Plaskett’s Star".
Between 1928 and 1935, Plaskett published a series of articles with Joseph Algernon Pearce on the radial velocities of stars and confirmed that our galaxy, the Milky Way, rotates.
In fact, he was the first to measure the size, mass and rotational speed of the Milky Way.
He also established that the Sun is located at 2/3 of the distance from the centre of our galaxy, and that our solar system takes approximately 220 million years to complete one galaxial rotation.
He took his retirement in 1935 and died in 1941 in Esquimalt, British Columbia at the age of 75.
In 1988, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Canadian Astronomical Society created the Plaskett Medal, awarded each year to the author of the best doctoral thesis in astronomy or astrophysics at a Canadian university.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Clarence Augustus Chant (1865-1956) The Father  of Canadian astronomy Clarence Augustus Chant was born in 1865 at Hagerman’s Corners, Ontario.
He finished high school in 1884 and taught for three years at a school.
He enrolled at the University of Toronto in 1887 and received his bachelor’s degree in 1890.
He secured a job with the Department of Finance in Ottawa, but only stayed for two years.
Chant was determined to obtain a university post, and in 1892, he was hired as a lecturer for the physics department at the University of Toronto.
In 1898, he spent the summer in Germany to study the theory of light, and in 1900 he received his Master’s degree while continuing his role as lecturer.
He left Toronto for Harvard University in the United States and returned the following year, doctoral degree in hand.
His interest for astronomy began in 1892 when he was hired by the physics department of the University of Toronto.
He joined the Physics and Astronomy Society of Toronto, which changed its name to the Astronomical Society of Toronto in 1900, and again to the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1902.
Chant acted as President from 1904 to 1907.
In 1904, Chant suggested that the University of Toronto increase the number of astronomy courses offered by the physics department.
His proposal was well received and six courses were added to the program in 1905.
Until a second professor was hired in 1926, Chant was the sole Canadian professor to train professional astronomers.
It was his role of having taught virtually all the original Canadian astronomers that earned Chant his reputation as the "Father  of Canadian astronomy".
No less than five of his former students went on to become directors of astronomical observatories.
In 1906, the lack of a large telescope in the Toronto region prompted Chant to campaign for an astronomical observatory that would be the property of the University of Toronto or the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Meanwhile, in the absence of a suitable telescope, he focused his research on total solar eclipses.
The astronomy department of the University of Toronto was officially established in 1920 and Chant became its first chairman.
The physics department consequently ceased to offer astronomy courses.
In 1921, Chant met David Dunlap, a lawyer and mining entrepreneur, and got him interested in the idea of building a large telescope observatory for the Toronto region.
Unfortunately, Dunlap died in 1924 and seemingly with him any chance of realizing Chant’s goal.
Chant led an expedition to Australia in 1922 to observe a total eclipse of the sun and to verify Einstein’s theory of relativity concerning the deflection of light by a body as massive as a star.
It proved to be one of the first verifications of Einstein’s theory.
In 1928, Chant published Our Wonderful Universe with enormous success, and the book was translated into five languages.
In 1935, the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto was inaugurated on the same day that Chant celebrated his 70th birthday, received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Toronto, and took his retirement.
At the time of its inauguration, the observatory housed the second largest telescope in the world, measuring 1.88 metres across.
Chant died in 1956 in Richmond Hill, Ontario, at the age of 91.
He published many scientific books and articles, and received numerous awards.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Carlyle Smith Beals (1899-1979) He expanded and developed astrophysics and geophysics in Canada Carlyle Smith Beals was born in 1899 at Canso, Nova Scotia.
He enrolled instead at the University of Toronto and obtained his Master’s degree in 1923.
Beals then returned to the University of Acadia where he was hired as assistant professor in physics.
He only stayed for one year before accepting a job in 1927 at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
He stayed at the observatory considerably longer: 20 years, in fact.
Shortly after his arrival, he began to perfect or invent new instruments for the observatory’s telescope.
He established a reliable temperature scale for very hot stars and was the first to demonstrate that their emission spectra are proof that they are surrounded by large gaseous envelopes.
He wrote a thesis on the subject and received a second doctoral degree from the University of London in 1934.
Beals also discovered that the wide emission lines from Wolf-Rayet and P Cygni-type stars are the result of gaseous material ejecting from their surfaces.
He was also the first to recognize that the gas in interstellar space is not uniformly distributed and that it is locally concentrated into clouds that move at high speeds.
In 1940, he became Adjoint Director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory of Victoria.
Beals attracted many young researchers to Ottawa, improved the institution’s seismological, gravimetric, magnetic and solar facilities, modernized its official time distribution service, installed new telescopes in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, installed cameras to observe meteors in Alberta, and established the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia.
In 1956, he began publishing geophysical studies on terrestrial and lunar impact craters, and in so doing demonstrated that meteorite bombardment played a major role in the formation of the planets, including Earth.
Beals retired in 1964 and died in 1979 in Ottawa at the age of 80.
He received many awards for his work in astronomy, geophysics and administration, including the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 3314 and a lunar crater were named in his honour.
In 1981, the Astronomical Society of Canada created the Carlyle S. Beals Award, given every two years to a Canadian astronomer, or an astronomer working in Canada, in recognition of their outstanding achievement in research.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Gerhard Herzberg (1904-1999) He helped make the National Research Council of Canada a world-renowned centre of excellence Gerhard Herzberg was born in 1904 at Hamburg, Germany.
During the early 1920’s, he decided to follow a career in astronomy but was quickly dissuaded by the scarcity of jobs in the field.
He enrolled at the Darmstadt Institute of Technology in 1924 where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in 1927 and a doctoral degree in physical engineering in 1928.
Specializing in atomic and molecular physics, he completed his first postdoctoral position at the University of Göttingen in 1928 and a second postdoctoral assignment at the University of Bristol in 1929.
In 1930, he was hired as a lecturer and assistant to the head of the physics department at the Darmstadt Institute of Technology.
He built a large spectroscopic laboratory and supervised the research of several students and guest researchers.
The German authorities would only allow him to leave with about $2.50, and he sought refuge in Canada where he was offered a guest professorship at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.
Three months later, he became professor in the physics department, a position he occupied for the next six years.
His work focused mainly on molecular spectroscopy; that is, on the analysis of molecular structure.
More specifically, Herzberg concentrated on the detection and the nature of free radicals.
Free radicals are intermediary molecules in chemical reactions that only exist for several millionths of a second in the laboratory, but much longer in space.
One of his first accomplishments at Saskatoon was to identify the CH+ molecule in interstellar clouds (clouds of gas found between stars).
At the time, only two other molecules had been identified in such an environment.
In addition to the numerous scientific articles that he wrote, he also published three books (1936, 1939 and 1945) that quickly became classics in atomic and molecular spectroscopy.
In 1945, the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago offered Herzberg a position as professor of spectroscopy at their extensive state-of-the-art facilities.
He studied comets and planetary atmospheres by perfecting methods that would go on to become standard techniques used around the world.
In 1948, he returned to Canada and was named Principal Research Officer at the National Research Council, and Director of the Division of Physics shortly afterwards.
He soon began to assemble a group of talented spectroscopists with specialities in various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (microwaves, infrared, visible light and ultraviolet light), and created research teams in the fields of theoretical and solid state physics.
Herzberg continued to add to his major scientific discoveries: he was the first to detect the hydrogen molecule in planetary atmospheres, the first to uncover the presence of water in comets, and the first to identify dozens of free radicals (including methylene CH2 and methyl CH3) in the laboratory and interstellar clouds.
He also established the National Research Council of Canada as a world leader in molecular spectroscopy.
In 1966, 1971 and 1979, he published three other books that each became a classic in molecular spectroscopy.
In 1969, the National Research Council of Canada created the post of Distinguished Research Scientist for him, which he occupied until his retirement.
In 1974, the Council combined its astronomy and spectroscopy units and created the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, where he worked until his retirement in 1995.
Herzberg died in Ottawa in 1999 at 94 years old.
He had received numerous distinctions, including the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Asteroid 3316 was named in his honour.
In 2004, the National Research Council of Canada created its highest honour, the Herzberg Medal, to bestow upon a scientist whose research contributions are characterized by both excellence and influence.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Helen Sawyer Hogg (1905-1993) A world expert in galaxy clusters and variable stars, she inspired many women to enter science and helped popularize astronomy in Canada Helen Sawyer was born in 1905 at Lowell, Massachusetts.
In 1922, she enrolled at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, and obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1926.
She then received her master’s degree in 1928 and her doctoral degree in 1931, both from Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Her research topic was the study of variable starts in globular clusters, and she would work on this type of star for the rest of her life.
In 1930, she married Frank Hogg, a young Canadian and fellow astronomy student.
In 1931, they moved to Canada where Frank accepted a post at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
Unfortunately, the depression had hit and Helen was unable to find work.
She nonetheless obtained permission to use the observatory’s telescope and was able to pursue her study of globular masses on a volunteer basis.
In 1935, Helen and Frank relocated to Ontario where Frank took a professorship with the astronomy department at the University of Toronto.
Helen pursued her observations of globular clusters at the David Dunlap Observatory, and she was hired as a research officer in the astronomy department in 1936.
Two years later, in 1941, she started teaching at the astronomy department of the University of Toronto.
In 1946, Helen’s husband Frank became Director of the David Dunlap Observatory, a position he would occupy until his death in 1951.
In 1957, Hogg became adjunct full professor in the astronomy department of the University of Toronto.
She continued her work on variable stars, which numbered more than 2,000 by the end of her career.
The parameters she measured during her research provided a basis for estimating the age of our galaxy and for improving our understanding of its evolution.
In 1970, Hogg hosted her own television show on astronomy.
In 1971, she founded the Astronomical Society of Canada and became its first president.
She retired in 1976, was named Professor Emeritus, and wrote a popular guide to astronomy titled The Stars Belong to Everyone.
Helen Sawyer Hogg died in Toronto at the age of 92.
She had received numerous distinctions for her work in astronomy and for her efforts to popularize the science, including the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 2917 was named in her honour.
In 1985, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Astronomical Society of Canada created the Helen Sawyer Hogg Public Lecture.
The lecture, given each year by an invited speaker during the annual meeting of the two societies, commemorates her contributions to public appreciation of the universe.
The Canadian National Museum of Science and Technology's observatory in Ottawa is named for her.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Andrew McKellar (1910-1960) Known around the world as one of Canada’s best astronomers, he was the first to measure the temperature of the Universe Andrew McKellar was born in 1910 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
In 1930, he received his bachelor’s degree from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and then enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley where he obtained his master’s degree in 1932 and his doctoral degree in 1933.
He specialized in molecular spectroscopy; that is, in the detection and analysis of molecular structure.
In 1933, he became a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.
It was there that he made his first forays into astronomy by studying the Sun.
In 1935, he accepted a position at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
He began measuring the orbits of binary stars and pursued his own research into molecular spectroscopy.
World War II erupted in 1939 and McKellar became a research officer for the Royal Canadian Navy.
He attained the rank of lieutenant commander, all the while pursuing his astronomy work and publishing several significant scientific articles.
In 1940, he began using spectroscopy to determine the composition of comets and demonstrated that solar rays modify their spectra.
Also in 1940, he was the first to detect the presence of matter in interstellar space when he identified the spectrum of the organic compounds cyanogen ("CN") and methyne ("CH").
In 1978, with McKellar having passed away almost twenty years earlier, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Penzias and Wilson for their part in the discovery that launched the Big Bang hypothesis to the forefront of cosmological theories.
When World War II ended in 1945, McKellar reclaimed his position as researcher at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria and remained there until his death in 1960.
In 1948, he was the first to provide proof of the existence of the carbon-nitrogen cycle ("CN cycle") within cold carbon stars.
The CN cycle, which had been predicted 10 years earlier, is a chain of thermonuclear reactions in which carbon and nitrogen combine to release enormous amounts of energy.
According to the theory, it is this energy that sustains cold carbon stars.
During the 1950’s, McKellar became increasingly interested in giant cold stars (those with surface temperatures as low as 2,000° C) and broadened our knowledge about their size and chemical composition.
Among other contributions, he demonstrated that large turbulent movements could agitate their atmospheres.
Succumbing to an incurable disease, he died in 1960 in Victoria, British Columbia, at the young age of 50.
He had completed a full day of work at the observatory just four days before he passed away.
McKellar received many awards for his work in astronomy, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
In 1962, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria named their 1.2-metre telescope in his honour.
The telescope is used to measure the speed of stars and to determine their chemical compositions.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Arthur Edwin Covington (1913-2001) As Canada’s first radio astronomer, he collected data on solar activity every day for more than thirty years; his work constitutes the world’s best database in the field Arthur Edwin Covington was born in 1913 in Regina, Saskatchewan.
In 1938, he received his bachelor’s degree from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and obtained his master’s degree from the same institution in 1940.
That same year, he enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley where, two years later in 1942, he received his doctoral degree in nuclear physics.
At that point, he moved to Ottawa, Ontario, and participated in the war effort by helping develop new radar systems at the National Research Council of Canada.
After the war, Covington proposed a research project that would convert surplus radar equipment into instruments that could study cosmic radiation.
His proposal was accepted in 1946 and he began constructing the first Canadian radio telescope.
Once the equipment had been calibrated, he decided to measure the radiation emanating from the Sun, or more specifically, it’s "radio flux": the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths.
He began collecting data in July of 1946 and quickly realized that the flux changed from day to day.
Unable to determine whether these daily variations were related to problems with the instruments or to the presence of dark spots ("sunspots") found on the Sun’s surface, he decided to use a partial solar eclipse on November 23, 1946, to his advantage: he would monitor any variations in the radio flux as sunspots became covered by the Moon.
Much to his surprise, he determined that the dimmer regions of the Sun – those marked by sunspots – emit much stronger radiation than the more luminous unmarked areas.
He thus provided the first direct evidence that sunspots are associated with radiation "hot spots".
Encouraged by this discovery, Covington began collecting daily data on the Sun’s radio flux in 1947, and succeeded in demonstrating that the number of sunspots is related to the Sun’s radiation flux.
He collected data on a continuous basis from that point forward and his measurements were used around the world.
In 1951, he constructed a device that would detect the radiation emitted by specific regions on the Sun’s surface.
He thus managed to measure the brilliance of the Sun’s corona (the uppermost level of the Sun’s atmosphere) and the temperature of the regions above sunspots (about 1,500,000 °C).
His work would greatly contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that create sunspots.
Covington succeeded in demonstrating that the intensity of solar radiation is related to the magnetic activity of the Sun, which has crucial implications for numerous human activities, such as communications systems, power lines, climate predictions, agriculture, fishing, space exploration, manmade satellites, geophysics, etc.
In 1959, the Algonquin Radio Observatory was established in Ontario and Covington became its director.
He took his retirement in 1978 and died in 2001 in Kingston, Ontario, at 88 years old.
One of the buildings at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Penticton was named in his honour in 2003.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Anne Barbara Underhill (1920-2003) A pioneer in the field of hot blue stars, she perfected sophisticated calculation techniques to better understand their atmospheres Anne Barbara Underhill was born in 1920 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
She obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1942 and her master’s degree in 1944 from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
In 1948, Underhill completed postdoctoral work at the Copenhagen Observatory in Denmark, and then joined the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia, where she stayed until 1962.
Underhill specialized in the study of "early-type stars" or "OB stars"; that is, very hot blue stars.
Newly discovered and poorly understood at the time, these stars were surrounded by very thick atmospheres.
Underhill collected a lot of data on OB stars at Victoria but quickly realized that no existing mathematical model could interpret her data.
Not one to give up, Underhill took it upon herself to develop and perfect the mathematical equations required to model the atmospheres of OB stars.
She began in the 1950’s, an era in which the only available computers were mechanical devices that had to be manually operated; it was an arduous task due to the enormous amount of time required to complete each calculation.
In 1962, Underhill became a professor of stellar astrophysics at Utrecht University in the Netherlands where she pursued her work on OB stars.
In 1966, she wrote The Early Type Stars, a book that quickly became a standard reference for OB stars.
In 1970, Underhill became the director of the new optical astronomy laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Maryland.
She contributed to the development of the International Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite until 1977, at which point she returned to her work on OB stars.
It was in the 1970’s that Underhill became convinced that Wolf-Rayet type stars are young, not old (an idea that we now know to be incorrect), and she retained this conviction for the rest of her life.
Wolf-Rayet stars release colossal quantities of matter into space.
She retired in 1985 and returned to Canada as Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia in Victoria.
She died in Vancouver at the age of 83.
She received numerous awards for her work in astronomy and was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Sidney van den Bergh (1929- ) A world expert in galaxy classification and the measurement of cosmic distances, he made several estimates of the size and age of the Universe Sidney van den Berg was born in 1929 in Wassenaar, Netherlands.
He spent one year at the University of Leiden and then went to Princeton University in the United States on a scholarship.
He received his bachelor’s degree from Princeton in 1950, and his master’s from Ohio State University in 1952.
He finished his studies in 1956 with a doctoral degree from the University of Göttingen in Germany.
He was hired as a professor at Ohio State University the same year he graduated, and he stayed there until 1958 when he accepted a professorship at the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto in Ontario.
He became involved in expanding the observatory’s facilities, perfecting computerized calculation techniques, and developing the field of polychrome photometry.
Van den Bergh’s main specialty was the study of meteors, but his interests quickly diversified and by 1960 he had already published numerous articles on globular clusters, interstellar clouds, galaxies and supernovae.
Four years later, he became President and Chairman of the Board of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation.
He retired in 1986, but retained a researcher position at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria.
Today, van den Bergh focuses his research on the classification and the evolution of galaxies using images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.
He retains an interest in a number of diverse subjects: among others, he published an article in 1992 that refuted the idea of an astronomical significance for the Nazca lines of Peru, and one in 1994 demonstrating that it is unlikely supernova explosions caused mass extinctions on Earth.
Van den Bergh has published more than 500 scientific articles.
He received numerous awards for his work and was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 4230 bears his name in his honour.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Hubert Reeves (1932- ) A specialist in the origin of light elements and a highly talented popularizer of astronomy, he is often called "the poet of the stars" Hubert Reeves was born in 1932 in Montreal, Quebec.
He received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Montreal in 1953, his master’s from McGill University in Montreal in 1955, and his doctoral degree from Cornell University in New York in 1960.
In 1965, he became the Director of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ("National Science Research Centre") in Paris and a scientific consultant for the Commissariat à l’énergie atomique ("Nuclear Energy Commission") in Saclay, France.
A specialist in astrophysics, Reeves studies the thermonuclear reactions that occur in stars; that is, the reactions that create the chemical elements that make up matter.
Since 1962, his work has focused on nuclear reactions involving carbon and oxygen.
He also focuses part of his research on neutrinos, a type of subatomic particle that we still know very little about.
In 1967, he became increasingly interested in the origin of the light elements lithium, beryllium and boron.
The very high temperatures that occur inside stars would destroy these three elements, so they must form elsewhere, namely out in space.
In 1968, he published Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, and in 1972 he wrote Nuclear Reactions in Stellar Surfaces and their Relations with Stellar Evolution.
These were the only two publications, among his many books, that were written for specialists in the field.
In 1971, Reeves helped demonstrate, along with other colleagues, that a process known as "spallation" creates lithium, beryllium and boron.
During this process, the atomic nuclei of relatively heavy elements, like oxygen, "break" under the impact of cosmic rays (particles that travel at high speed through space).
Some of the "pieces" created by these collisions are lithium, beryllium or boron atoms.
In 1972, Reeves collaborated with Johannes Geiss to explain the origin of two other light elements: deuterium and helium-3.
The test for their hypothesis was made possible by experiments conducted during the Apollo moon missions, and the results also allowed them to estimate the density of normal matter in the Universe.
In 1977, Reeves published Soleil ("Sun"), his first popular science book.
Four years later, in 1981, he wrote another, Patience dans l’azur ("Patience in the Sky"), about the different steps in the formation of the Universe that gained immediate international acclaim.
Another 15 or so popular astronomy books were published in the years to follow, some with co-authors.
The beginning of the 1980’s marked a time of increasing popularity for Reeves as he gave many public lectures and appeared on television shows and in films, speaking not just on the topic of astronomy, but also the environment.
Reeves received many awards and distinctions for his work in astronomy and public communications.
In 2001, he and Johannes Geiss received the Einstein prize for their work on the density of the Universe.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers René Racine (1939- ) As an inventor of exceptional astronomical instruments, he played a key role in the creation of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory René Racine was born in 1939 in Quebec City.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from Laval University in Quebec City in 1963, and went on to the University of Toronto where he received his master’s degree in 1965 and his doctoral degree in 1967.
He then obtained a research scholarship at the Carnegie Institute and spent the next two years (1967-1969) at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories near Pasadena, California.
Racine specializes in the study of globular clusters.
Globular clusters are collections of stars that form a spherical shape containing anywhere from 10,000 to millions of stars.
Racine studies them using photometry, a technique that measures the intensity of light emitted from an object, which can be used to extract information about its size, temperature, etc.
In 1969, he became a professor in the astronomy and astrophysics department of the University of Toronto.
Upon his arrival, Racine teamed up with colleagues Sidney van den Bergh and Robert F. Garrison to propose that the new observatory for the university be built at Las Campanas in Chile.
The 60-centimetre telescope saw first light in 1971, and Racine equipped it with a new photometer of his own design.
In 1976, he became astronomy professor for the physics department at the University of Montreal.
Racine played a key role in the creation of the new Mont-Mégantic Observatory and was its director from 1976 to 1980.
In 1980, he was named Executive Director of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation (CFWT).
He worked on improving the image quality of the telescope and succeeded in producing the highest resolution images in the world, all the while pursuing his work in astronomical research.
In 1984, he left his post as Director of the CFWT and returned as Director of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory.
In 1997, he retired from his positions as Adjunct Full Professor and Director of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory, and became Professor Emeritus at the University of Montreal.
Racine was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1989 and the Order of Canada in 1999.
In 2005, he was made an Officer of the Ordre national du Québec (National Order of Quebec).
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Barrie Hutchings (1941- ) He was the first to discover a black hole outside our galaxy John Barrie Hutchings was born in 1941 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
He received his bachelor’s degree in 1962, his bachelor’s with Honours in 1963, and his master’s in 1964 from the Rand University of South Africa.
He then obtained his doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge in England in 1967.
From 1967 to 1969, he took a position as a postdoctoral researcher at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia, and he remains there as a researcher to this day.
Hutchings specializes in the atmospheres of OB stars (very hot blue stars).
In 1968, he discovered that these stars, which have very thick atmospheres, generate hot stellar winds.
In 1983, after ten years of research on binary stars, he made a major discovery:
Hutchings, along with coworkers Anne Cowley and David Crampton, identified the first black hole located outside our galaxy.
Not even one year later, in 1984, he made a second remarkable discovery by proving, along with David Crampton and Bruce Campbell, that quasars are the centres of active galaxies.
Active galaxies are those with centres marked by enormous energy outputs.
Over the years, the study of quasars became one of Hutchings specialties.
In 1987, he became part of the FUSE satellite science team as Canada’s Project Scientist (FUSE stands for "Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer").
In 1994, Hutchings became Chairman of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
In 1997, thanks to a newly installed spectrograph on the HST, he and some of his collaborators were the first to observe plumes of matter emitted from the centres of active galaxies.
In 1998, he was named Canadian Principal Investigator for the proposed CUVIT space mission (Canadian UV Imaging Telescope).
In 2000, Hutchings became Canada’s Principal Investigator for ASTROSAT, a satellite launched by the Indian Space Research Organization to study galactic objects and distant extra-galactic objects.
Hutchings has published more than 400 scientific articles to date.
He received numerous distinctions for his work, including his election as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Charles Thomas Bolton (1943- ) He was the first to discover a black hole Charles Thomas Bolton was born in 1943 at Camp Forrest, a World War II military base in Tennessee, United States.
He received his bachelor’s degree in 1966 from the University of Illinois and his master’s (1968) and doctoral degrees (1970) from the University of Michigan.
From 1970 to 1972, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto astronomy department.
He also taught at the David Dunlap Observatory from 1970 to 1972, at Scarborough College from 1971 to 1972, and at Erindale College from 1972 to 1973.
He then became a professor in the astronomy department at the University of Toronto in 1973, and has remained there ever since.
In 1970, Bolton was the first to develop a computer model for stellar atmospheres that was able to generate large regions of the modeled spectrum with enough precision to allow comparison with the spectra from real stars.
In 1972, Bolton made a discovery in astronomy that was so important it guaranteed him a place in the history books: he was the first astronomer to present irrefutable evidence of the existence of a black hole.
The black hole in question was Cygnus X-1, which lies at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.
Bolton detected its presence by observing star HDE 226868 wobble as if it was orbiting around an invisible but massive companion.
His calculations demonstrated that the companion could be nothing less than a black hole.
A black hole is a celestial body that is so massive and dense that nothing can escape its gravitational pull (its attractive force), not even light.
The name arises from the fact that it cannot emit light and thus appears black, and it traps all that falls into it, like a hole in space.
In 1978, Bolton demonstrated that the nitrogen anomalies observed in the spectra of OBN stars are due to the transfer of material to a nearby neighbouring star.
OB stars are very hot blue stars with thick atmospheres.
OBN stars are a subclass of OB stars that are characterized by nitrogen anomalies in their spectra.
In 1981, he suggested that the ejections of material from Be-type stars – a subclass of B stars – are caused by non-radial pulsations (vibrations that shake Be stars in an irregular manner).
Bolton established a Canadian first in the 1990’s when he wrote a bylaw to regulate light pollution that was adopted by the town of Richmond Hill, Ontario, in 1994.
Bolton has received many awards for his work, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jean-René Roy (1943- ) Astrophysicist and current Director of the Gemini Astronomical Observatory, which owns two of the biggest telescopes in the world Jean-René Roy was born in 1943 in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec.
He received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Montreal in Quebec in 1969 before moving to the University of Western Ontario in London where he obtained his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1971 and 1973.
In 1977, he organized a workshop on the causes of the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction that marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs.
That same year, Roy became an astronomy professor in the physics department at Laval University in Quebec City and later contributed to the creation of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory, which was inaugurated in 1978.
In 1982, Roy published his first book, L’astronomie et son histoire ("Astronomy and its History").
That same year, he and his colleagues, Yvon Georgelin and Jacques Boulesteix, designed a new Fabry-Perot interferometer for the Mont-Mégantic Observatory.
Other instruments were to follow.
In 1997, he became a member of the board of directors for the Gemini Project, a proposal to construct the two largest telescopes in the world.
One of the telescopes would be located in the northern hemisphere (Hawaii) and the other in the southern hemisphere (Chile).
In 2000, he left Laval University to become the scientific director for the Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii.
His current research interests are spiral galaxies, the processes of massive star formation, and the chemical enrichment in galaxies.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Peter Gordon Martin (1947- ) A specialist in the study of interstellar matter, he was involved in numerous international research projects Peter Gordon Martin was born in 1947 at Owen Sound  in Ontario.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from the University of Toronto in 1968 and his master’s degree in 1969.
Three years later, in 1972, he received his doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge in England, and then returned to the University of Toronto to take a post as professor.
He strives to understand its origin and its relationship to stars.
To do this, he analyzes and interprets data gathered by telescopes on Earth and in space, and integrates these data into theoretical computer simulations.
During the first 15 years of his career, Martin concentrated mainly on interstellar dust.
Subjected to the magnetic fields produced by various celestial objects, interstellar dust tends to align itself in space like a magnet.
Any light passing through these particles likewise become aligned (the light becomes "polarized"), and by studying this light, it becomes possible to extract information about the composition and shape of the interstellar grains.
In 1984, Martin became the first person from the astronomy department at the University of Toronto to become a member of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
Not long after, in 1987, he became interested in the collisions affecting hydrogen molecules of interstellar gas clouds where stars are born.
His contributions in this field have repercussions for our understanding of how the first stars of the Universe came to be.
Martin used the Orion nebula as a case study in 1991 to examine the conditions within nebulas and other regions where interstellar matter is concentrated.
The results of these studies have improved our understanding of the evolution of galaxies in the Universe.
In 1995, he became a permanent member of the science committee that manages the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, a project that aims to map a large portion (60 degrees) of our galaxial plane at several different wavelengths using a common resolution.
Martin uses the collected data to study the formation of massive stars and the evolution of interstellar dust, as well as its influence on the ecology of our galaxy.
In 1999, Martin was named Director of the University of Toronto’s David Dunlap Observatory.
He is currently involved in a number of international research projects, including the James Webb Space Telescope (the successor of the Hubble Space Telescope), the Herschel Space Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Planck space mission.
Martin received the Carlyle S. Beals Award in 1994 from the Astronomical Society of Canada in recognition of his research contributions.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Gilles Fontaine (1948- ) An asteroseismologist and world specialist in white dwarf stars Gilles Fontaine was born in 1948 at Lévis, near Quebec City.
In 1969, he obtained his bachelor’s degree from Laval University in Quebec City, and his doctoral degree in 1974 from the University of Rochester in the state of New York.
He then took a postdoctoral position at the University of Western Ontario in London, and in 1977 he became a professor at the University of Montreal.
Fontaine has specialized in the study of white dwarf stars since he first started his doctoral studies.
A white dwarf forms when a star depletes its nuclear fuel.
Asteroseismologists – scientist who study the vibrations of stars – can measure these changes in intensity with an instrument known as a photometer.
There is a great interest for studying stellar vibrations because they allow scientists to obtain information about the internal structure of a star, and thus about its size, mass and composition.
It is analogous to seismology, in which geophysicists study earthquakes as a means to probe the internal structure of the Earth.
In 1982, only one year after forming, the team used mathematical models to predict the existence of a new type of pulsating star: the DB-type white dwarf.
That same year, their prediction was confirmed by telescopic observations of a DB white dwarf.
It was a first in astrophysics because, up to that point, new star types were discovered before being theoretically predicted.
In 1987, Fontaine and his collaborators had the idea to determine the age of the Universe using white dwarfs.
Since white dwarfs are very old stars nearing the end of their life, to determine their age would effectively estimate the age of the galaxy and – in the bigger picture – that of the Universe.
In order to accomplish this goal, Fontaine designed numerical simulation models that weighted several parameters for a given star – such as mass, temperature and luminosity – and calculated the time that it would take for the white dwarf to cool.
In 1990, Fontaine published the first results within the framework of the Montréal-Cambridge-Tololo Project, which he helped develop.
The main goal of the project was the systematic exploration of white dwarfs in the southern hemisphere.
In 1996, Fontaine and his team once again theoretically predicted the existence of a new type of star, a B-type white subdwarf, and astronomers once again confirmed its existence, this time at the South African Astronomical Observatory in 1997.
In the years since, Fontaine and his collaborators have continued to predict other types of stars.
Fontaine received numerous distinctions for his work, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Asteroid 4230 is named in his honour.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Richard Bond (1950- ) World expert in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, he made Canada a leader in cosmology John Richard Bond was born in 1950 in Toronto.
In 1973, he obtained his bachelor’s degree from the University of Toronto and enrolled at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974.
He became a member of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and helped establish the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
Bond specializes in the study of the structure of the Universe.
During the 1980’s, very few researchers believed that it would be possible to detect variations in the cosmic background radiation due to its incredibly old age of 14 billion years.
However, in 1991, the COBE satellite (COsmic Background Explorer) did indeed reveal slight variations.
Encouraged by these results, Bond continued to develop many sophisticated mathematical tools during the 1990’s in order to study these variations.
He published many significant articles that established new rigorous standards in various disciplines or created entirely new research domains.
Bond’s studies were so numerous between 1981 and 1997 that he was the most cited Canadian astronomer in specialized journals during that time (more than 3,000 citations).
In 1996, he was named Director of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
In 1998, the first Boomerang mission was launched above the Antarctic.
It consisted of a balloon that carried a 1.20-metre telescope (named Boomerang) to an altitude of 35 kilometres to avoid the terrestrial atmosphere that would interfere with its instruments.
In 2000, Bond and several colleagues used the Boomerang results to demonstrate that the Universe has a planar geometry and to confirm that it is expanding.
In 2001, Bond became director of research programs at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.
Today, he tries to understand the cause of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, which is to understand the very nature of dark energy that Einstein first introduced in his theories as "the cosmological constant".
It is proposed that dark energy is a repulsive force that counterbalances and may exceed the braking force of gravity; it is the force that attempts to push the expansion of the Universe to infinity.
According to Bond, it is possible that some small trace – some evidence – of the existence of dark energy could be found in the cosmic background radiation.
Bond received (and continues to receive) numerous national and international awards for his work, including being elected as a member to the Royal Society of Canada.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Scott Duncan Tremaine (1950- ) As a world expert in cosmic dynamics, he made several predictions that were subsequently confirmed by observation Scott Duncan Tremaine was born in 1950 in Toronto.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from McMaster’s University in 1971, and his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1973 and 1975 respectively from the University of Princeton in the United States.
Upon obtaining his doctoral degree, he was hired as a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He stayed for two years and then moved to England in 1977 to become a research agent in the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge.
One year later, he returned to the United States to be a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University in New Jersey.
Tremaine is an expert in cosmic dynamics; that is, the study of the effects of forces that move celestial objects.
In simple terms, he is trying to determine the changes in speeds and directions that affect various bodies.
He has applied this type of study to planetary rings, comets, planets, black holes, galaxies and galaxy clusters.
In 1979, he and Peter Goldreich predicted that the rings of Uranus (discovered in 1977) are kept in place by small moons that have not yet been detected.
The proposal met with scepticism from many astronomers, until the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past the planet in 1986 and confirmed the prediction.
It was quite a triumph.
Thanks to his energy, the institute eventually carved itself an enviable position in the international scene.
In 1987, Tremaine wrote the book Galactic Dynamics with James Binney, which quickly became a reference work in the field.
In 1988, he and other collaborators demonstrated that comets with short periods (comets that visit us every 200 years or less) originate in the Kuiper belt and not the Oort cloud.
This revelation proved to be another high point in his career.
In 1991, Tremaine and Michel Fich determined the mass of our galaxy, the Milky Way, by using information about satellite galaxies (those that orbit our own).
In 1996, he left his position as Director of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics to head the Cosmology and Gravity Program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Studies.
One year later, in 1997, he left the University of Toronto to become a professor at Princeton University in the United States where he remains today.
Tremaine has received many awards, including being elected as member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jaymie Mark Matthews (1958- ) Asteroseismologist, outstanding popularizer of astronomy, and mission scientist for MOST: the first Canadian space telescope Jaymie Mark Matthews was born in 1958 in Chatham, Ontario.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in 1979 from the University of Toronto and his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1982 and 1987 from the University of Western Ontario in London.
In 1988, he undertook postdoctoral research at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
In 1991, he was hired as a research agent at the University of Montreal.
He then became a professor at the University of British Columbia.
Matthews is an asteroseismologist; that is, he specializes in the study of the vibrations (pulsations) that shake stars.
All stars, like the Sun, vibrate at some time during their lifespan.
The study of such vibrations holds great interest for researchers as it provides information on the internal structure of a star, and thus on its size, mass, composition and even age.
In addition to asteroseismology, Matthews has other interests.
In 1987, he began studying Wolf-Rayet stars, which are stars that liberate colossal amounts of matter into space.
In 1992, he tackled the job of mapping solar spots on stars using Doppler imaging.
In 1994, he used open star clusters and groups of open star clusters to calibrate a scale for cosmological distances.
The year 1997 was a particularly significant year for Matthews.
In 2003, after six years of preparation, the MOST satellite was launched.
The satellite is the size and shape of a large suitcase, and is equipped with an ultra sensitive telescope that measures only 15 centimetres across.
Despite its small size, it is ten times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope in detecting tiny variations in the luminosity of stars caused by pulsations that shake their surface.
Since 2004, the discoveries made by Matthews and the MOST satellite regularly make the headlines in the media around the world.
In addition to his research activities, Matthews is constantly involved in all sorts of activities related to popularizing science: newspaper interviews, radio and television appearances, public conferences, telescope tours, supervising students in high school, evening courses, summer camps, work sponsorships, etc.
Particularly popular with young people, he received awards for excellence in teaching in 1999 and 2002.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jack Newton (1942- ) Known for his world famous photographs Jack Newton was born in 1942 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
He obtained a diploma in business administration during the 1970’s from Red River Community College and became manager for the stores Sears and Marks & Spencer.
His interest in astronomy began in 1954 at the age of 12.
Four years later, in 1958, he joined the Winnipeg Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
In 1969, he constructed a 32-centimetre telescope and installed it under a dome in his backyard.
He then started up an astrophotography section with the Winnipeg Centre and became the president from 1970 to 1972.
In 1973, Newton’s work required him to move to Toronto.
He began to test different film types for his photography work and one year later, in 1974, he published Astro Photography:
In 1975, he was elected president of the Toronto Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Still passionate about photography, he published An Introduction to CCD Astronomy and Deep Sky Objects:
A Photographic Guide for the Amateur in 1977.
In 1979, Newton moved again for work-related reasons, this time to Victoria in British Columbia.
He continued to pursue his astrophotography activities and became the president of the Victoria Centre from 1980 to 1981.
He wrote two books with Philip Teece:
Cambridge Deep-Sky Album in 1983, and The Guide to Amateur Astronomy in 1988.
From 1990 to 1991, he again became president of the Victoria Centre and, in 1995, he and Philip Teece wrote a second edition to their book The Guide to Amateur Astronomy.
In 1997, he joined forces with Terence Dickinson and published Splendors of the Universe:
Throughout his career as an amateur astronomer, Newton regularly contributed to the magazines Astronomy, Sky & Telescope and SkyNews, and his photographs could be found in many popular media magazines like Newsweek and Canadian Geographic, or in books like The Audubon Society Field Guide to the Night Sky.
One of his more ambitious trips was in 1986 when he headed a contingent of more than 300 people to see Halley’s comet over Peruvian skies!
Newton received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, the Ken Chilton Prize from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1978, the Amateur Achievement Award from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1988, and the Chant Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1989.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Damien Lemay (1943- ) An extraordinary amateur observer, he works at all levels to popularize amateur astronomy in Canada Damien Lemay was born in 1943 at Saint-Édouard de Lotbinière in Quebec.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in physics in 1966 from Laval University in Quebec, and became a telecommunications engineer for Québec-Téléphone (now TELUS-Québec).
Lemay made his first forays into astronomy around 1954 at the age of 11.
In 1962, he bought his first telescope, a 11.4-centimetre Tasco reflector that he still has today.
From 1971 to 1972, he used 7x50 binoculars to observe all the stars in the Norton Star Atlas, from the North Pole to -35° South.
In 1973, he took his first long-exposure photos during a guided tour over the night of May 26.
Astrophotography quickly became one of Lemay’s passions and he equipped himself, by the end of that same year, with a 20.3-centimetre Schmidt Cassegrain telescope.
Lemay was probably the first North American observer to see Nova Cygni in the sky in 1975.
A nova is a star that absorbs matter from a neighbouring star, which causes the new host to heat up and suddenly brighten.
It is a rare and spectacular event.
In 1977, he became the French editor of the National Newsletter of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada; he would keep this position until 1989.
In 1978, Lemay began the daunting task of assembling a photographic atlas of the sky using his 14-centimetre Schmidt camera.
He completed the work in 1985 after taking 1,182 photographs.
In 1981, he founded the Astronomy Club of Rimouski in Quebec.
The club was very active and they twice organized the annual conference of the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec in 1990 and 1997.
In 1983, Lemay initiated the first joint meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec, and the American Association of Variable Star Observers.
The conference took place in Quebec City, and with over 200 participants it was deemed an unequivocal success.
From 1990 to 1992, he was the National President of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
From 1992 to 2000, he was Codirector, with R. Hawkes, of the Canadian Fireball Reporting Centre.
The centre operates from Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, and collects statistical data about falling stars that appear over Canadian skies.
The primary goal is to help recover meteorites in the short and long term.
In 2001, the centre moved to the University of Calgary where it falls under the responsibility of Alan Hildebrand.
In 1996, he was one of the founding members of the virtual group ASTRO & CCD of the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec.
The group works solely through the Internet and its members share their digital photos with each other.
From 1997 to 2000, he was Chairman of the Meteorite and Impacts Advisory Committee of the Canadian Space Agency.
Throughout his years as an amateur astronomer, Lemay has helped newcomers in choosing equipment and learning how to observe the sky, and he gives dozens of lectures and presentations each year at schools, scout camps, parks, etc.
He received several provincial and national distinctions in honour of his contributions in astronomy, including the Trophée Méritas ("Méritas Trophy") from the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec in 1982, and the Chant Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Paul Boltwood (1943- ) Renowned for his attention to detail, he took the best image of the deep sky ever obtained using amateur equipment Paul Boltwood was born in 1943 at Vancouver, British Columbia.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1966 from the University of British Columbia in Victoria, and went on to occupy various jobs before becoming President of his own company, Boltwood Systems Corporation, in 1980.
He became interested in astronomy around 1955 and constructed his first telescope around 1958.
After training himself in many techniques, he had completed everything by 1992.
In 1993, he constructed his first telescope with the intent of selling it.
Boltwood also began his own survey of blazars OJ 287 and 3C 66A.
Blazars are galaxies that are tilted such that the jets of radiation emanating from their core are aimed straight at Earth.
The observations and data that he gathered with his amateur equipment were of such good quality that he was able to collaborate with professional astronomers.
In 1997, Boltwood produced fantastic footage of the Hyakutake comet nucleus using his own equipment.
Boltwood was deemed to have taken the best image of the deep sky ever obtained using amateur equipment.
Using his 40-centimetre telescope (that he built himself), his CCD camera, an exposure time of 20 hours in his backyard near Ottawa, and digital processing of the image using software that he developed, Boltwood attained a magnitude of 24.1, even better than the Mount Palomar telescope!
He even managed to improve the image later to a magnitude of 24.5.

Levy’s interest in astronomy began during a partial eclipse of the Sun in 1959 at the age of 11.
In 1965, he began to search for novae and comets in the sky.
By the end of the 1980’s, he was the most prolific observer in the American Association of Variable Star Observers with more than 10,000 observations per year for meteors, variable stars and Messier objects.
Always looking for a better climate and a darker sky, he moved to Arizona in 1980 where he still lives today.
In 1984, after 19 years of fruitless searching, he discovered his first comet.
Today, he is the discoverer or co-discoverer of 21 comets and more than 225 asteroids, including the famous Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet that crashed into Jupiter in 1994.
Author or editor of more than thirty books, numerous articles and more than 1,000 lectures and interviews, Levy is also involved with a number of magazines: he is Science Editor of Parade (USA), Associate Editor of Sky & Telescope (USA), and a regular contributor to SkyNews (Canada).
Over the years, he has developed numerous educational programs in astronomy for young people and the general public.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments The human eye An extraordinary organ The eye is the organ that allows us to see.
Light enters through the cornea and is projected onto the retina, which consists of cells that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.
From there, the light signals are converted into electrical impulses that are transmitted to the brain along the optic nerve.
Once the brain has received the pulses, it transforms the information into an image.
The human eye is spherical and its internal parts are transparent so that the maximum amount of light can reach the retina.
The cornea surrounds and protects the eye.
It is made of transparent gel-like material that helps converge light rays onto the retina.
The role of the iris is to control the quantity of light that passes through the cornea, keeping it at a fairly constant level.
Too much light can damage the retina, whereas not enough will prevent a person from seeing properly.
Its centre, the pupil, allows just the right amount of light to pass through so that we can see.
This is why the pupil contracts when there is too much light (like when the Sun blinds us) to prevent excess light rays from reaching the retina, and contracts when there is not enough light (like when we walk into a darkened room) to allow in the most light possible.
Immediately behind the iris is the lens.
It is a true lens in that it converges light rays passing through the eye onto the retina.
The lens of the eye is also flexible and can deform itself to improve the convergence of light.
On the other hand, they are not very sensitive to light rays and need a lot of light to work.
The rods are very sensitive to light and enable us to see when it is dark.
They are not, however, capable of distinguishing different colours and details, and this causes the poor colour contrast between objects that we observe when the lighting is dim.
In all, hundreds of millions of cells must work together in our eyes and brain in order for us to see.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments The first instruments The transit and the sextant
Many different astronomical instruments have been used throughout the ages.
Two stand out as having played particularly important historical roles: the transit and the sextant.
Such diverse fields as stellar cartography (mapping), navigation and the determination of time have all progressed significantly thanks to these instruments.
The transit is used to measure the precise moment that a celestial object passes through its highest point in the sky (also know as the meridian).
Used since ancient Egyptian time, the modern form of this instrument consists of a telescope that only moves vertically.
A dial on one side, graduated from 0 to 90 degrees, is used to measure the inclination of the telescope.
When the celestial object in question passes through the meridian, the observer notes its angle above the horizon at the precise moment of its passing.
These two measurements provide the coordinates (the position) of the object in the celestial sphere.
A map of the sky can be thus be assembled bit by bit and used to create tables that give the positions of stars, planets, the Moon and so on for the purposes of navigation or determining the exact time.
The sextant is an instrument that can be used to determine the angle between a celestial object and the horizon.
Used in conjunction with the transit tables, it is a simple matter to calculate the latitude of one’s position.
The predecessors of the sextant included the astrolab and the octant, both of which operated on the same principle.
The modern version of the sextant was independently invented in the 1730’s by John Hadley in England and Thomas Godfrey in the United States.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments Refracting telescopes Concentrating light by refraction through lenses The Assyrians (people who lived in a region that is known today as Iraq) were perhaps the first to have used lenses to magnify objects, possibly around 1,500 BC.
The evidence is a rock crystal discovered by the English archaeologist John Layard in 1850 during the excavation of the ancient city of Nimrud.
The crystal was cut and polished into the shape of a lens, however it is not entirely certain that it was used as a magnifying lens and not as jewellery or for some other purpose.
Evidence that lenses were in use during the first century BC can be found in the records of the Roman authors Pliny and Senecio who reported that an engraver at Pompeii used a lens to help him in his work.
Other historical evidence reveals that the Arabs were using lenses by the year 600 AD, as were the Vikings around the year 900.
It is difficult to determine when a refracting telescope was first assembled using lenses.
The first person to do so with certainty, and thus the person to be credited with its invention, was the English mathematician Leonard Digges who constructed a refracting telescope sometime between 1540 and 1553 to assist with his topographic surveys.
Leonard Digges – or perhaps his son, the English astronomer Thomas Digges – was also the first to turn a refractor towards the sky to study celestial objects.
The instrument did not become widely known to the public until 1608 when Hans Lippershey (or Lipperhey), a Dutch optician of German origin, began to make and sell telescopes.
Lippershey applied for a patent for what he claimed was his own invention, but was refused on the grounds that the device was already in existence.
The English mathematician Thomas Harriot was the first to study the Moon in detail using an astronomical telescope in 1609, and it is known with certainty that this occurred several months before Galileo Galilei, the famous Italian physicist, did the same.
Galilei, however, was the first to have published his observations in a book entitled "The Starry Messenger" (translated from Latin).
His book revolutionized our concept of the Universe.
The first refracting telescopes consisted of two lenses separated by some distance within a closed tube.
The larger of the two is the objective, or primary lens, and the second is the ocular.
The role of the lenses is to concentrate light rays into a single point – the focal point – so as to obtain a sharper magnified image.
It is the glass of the lens that allows light to be concentrated.
This phenomenon is known as "refraction".
Lenses, to be effective in a telescope, must be shaped so that all the refracted light rays converge in a single point.
Unfortunately, we now know today that it is impossible to focus light from an object into a single point using only one lens.
There are several types of aberrations, the main ones being chromatic and spherical.
All types of aberration cause deformation of the image transmitted by the telescope.
Chromatic aberration occurs because light rays of different colours are not all bent by the same amount as they pass through a lens.
Consequently, it is impossible to concentrate the rays into a single point.
Chromatic aberration causes coloured fringes to appear around the image.
Spherical aberration is due to the shape of the lens.
A lens is nothing more than a piece of glass with each surface shaped like a portion of a sphere.
Unfortunately, a sphere is not the best shape for concentrating light rays into a single point, but is the easiest shape to make when grinding and polishing glass.
Spherical aberration causes images to be blurred.
These days, refracting telescopes are made using several lenses that are designed and put together in ways that minimize the problems caused by aberrations.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments Reflecting telescopes Concentrating light using mirrors In contrast to a refracting telescope, which uses lenses to enlarge images, reflecting telescopes (also known as reflectors) use mirrors to accomplish the same goal.
The advantages are numerous: manufacturing mirrors is simpler and less costly than lenses, there are less aberration-related problems, and the main mirror can be supported from below.
Today, the reflecting telescope is considered as one of the most powerful scientific instruments ever invented.
Sometime between 1540 and 1553, the English mathematician Leonard Digges constructed the first reflecting telescope using a mirror and a lens.
In 1576, his son Thomas, an astronomer, used it to defend the idea that the Universe is infinite, which was a revolutionary concept at the time.
Nevertheless, it would be another 100 years before the reflecting telescope was widely used.
In 1663, the Scottish mathematician and astronomer James Gregory published his book Optima Promota in which he included the design for a new type of compact reflecting telescope.
The English physicist Robert Hooke built the actual instrument several years later, only a short time before Isaac Newton developed his own telescope in 1668.
The principle behind Newton’s telescope was so simple that we still use it today.
It consists of two mirrors: the primary and the secondary.
The primary mirror has a parabolic shape and serves to collect light from the object of interest.
The secondary mirror, smaller than the primary, is flat and inclined in such a way as to reflect light from the primary mirror towards the ocular and the observer.
In 1672, the Catholic priest and French teacher Laurent Cassegrain invented a new type of reflecting telescope that he described in an unpublished manuscript.
The Cassegrain telescope consisted of a primary parabolic mirror, which collected light from the celestial object, and a secondary mirror, which faced the primary mirror and concentrated the reflected light towards the observer by directing it through a hole in the centre of the primary mirror.
The image could therefore be viewed from behind the telescope, and not from the side, as with Newton’s design.
The big advantage to the Cassegrain design is its compact size, which makes it portable.
Moreover, heavy instruments can be installed at its based.
Today, the Cassegrain reflector is the most commonly used type of telescope.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments Invisible light collectors Seeing the invisible Refracting and reflecting telescopes are used to collect and study visible light.
Although visible light provides valuable information, it only represents a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
To see the rest of the spectrum, which consists of invisible colours, researchers need to use collectors that are capable of detecting wavelengths that correspond to the type of light they wish to study.
For the infrared domain, the parabolic mirror of a reflecting telescope remains the ideal means by which to collect and concentrate the light rays.
Because the light being collected is invisible, the human observer is replaced by an infrared detector at the mirror’s focal point.
Its purpose is to measure the intensity of the infrared rays.
Unfortunately, the situation is considerably more complex for the mid- and far-infrared domains.
One of the complications for detecting infrared sources in space is that the reflecting telescope collects a lot of background infrared light from the atmosphere, from any human observers present in the room, and from the telescope itself.
In addition, atmospheric water vapour absorbs a large part of the infrared rays coming from space, which makes data collection difficult – or even impossible – at some wavelengths.
To overcome these problems, detectors are cooled to very low temperatures (sometimes down to -269 °C) and the telescopes are placed at the highest elevations possible where the air is drier.
Another solution is to put them directly into space, orbiting Earth.
The great interest for astronomers in observing the infrared light of the Universe is due to its powers of penetration.
Infrared waves are capable of passing through dust, allowing us to see regions that are otherwise impenetrable to visible light, such as the interiors of nebulas.
At longer wavelengths in the microwave domain, absorption by water is a persistent problem and the best solutions are to collect data from high elevations or satellites.
In order for light rays to be concentrated at the focal point of a reflecting telescope, the size of the irregularities in the curve of the parabolic collector must be smaller than the wavelength of the light being collected.
Consequently, it is not necessary to use a highly polished reflecting surface like a mirror for light with very long wavelengths, like microwaves; instead, a simple metal dish will suffice.
Microwaves are of immense interest to astronomers.
Cosmic background radiation – that amazing "first light" emitted when the Universe was only a few hundred thousand years old – exists mainly in the form of microwaves.
Radio waves, which have even longer and less energetic wavelengths than microwaves, are typically collected using large metal dishes.
Radio waves are produced by supernova remnants and by electrons passing through the magnetic fields of distant radio galaxies.
For light with wavelengths that are shorter than those of visible light, like ultraviolet rays, it is possible to use optical telescopes.
Unfortunately for astronomers (but fortunately for human beings), most ultraviolet light is absorbed by the ozone layer before reaching Earth’s surface.
It is therefore necessary to use satellites for ultraviolet studies.
Ultraviolet light is the most abundant type of energy generated by very hot stars.
Satellites must also be used to study X-rays and gamma rays, which have wavelengths that are even shorter and more energetic than those of ultraviolet rays.
These light rays are so energetic, however, that they can easily pass through mirrors; special collectors must be used to detect them.
Most X-rays are emitted by pockets of hot gases found between galaxies and near black holes.
Gamma rays are mainly found in the vicinity of supernova explosions.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Photographic plates Memorizing light In the early days of astronomy, astronomers had to draw their observations on paper.
The method was, of course, imperfect and prone not only to errors in reproduction, but also to the unintentional omission of important details.
The invention of photography, which could accurately transfer images to paper, was quickly adopted as a convenient solution.
In fact, astronomers began using photography almost as soon as it was invented.
The principle behind photography is the use of light-sensitive chemicals, like silver salts.
These are dispersed in a gel to create a mixture known as emulsion.
Once the emulsion is exposed to light, the light-sensitive chemicals react and become opaque to varying degrees depending on the amount of exposure.
The result is a photographic image.
It was in 1793 that the French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce first began thinking of a method to record light.
He started experimenting in 1814 and succeeded in setting images on paper in 1816.
In 1822, he made the first permanent photo by using a sheet of polished tin coated with a petroleum derivative called bitumen of Judea (a type of tar).
Unaware of the progress made by Niépce, the British scientist William Henry Fox Talbot began his own set of experiments in 1834 and recorded images on paper in 1835.
His process became known in 1839 and he obtained a patent in 1841.
The French inventor Hippolyte Bayard began his experiments before 1836, but it was only in 1839 that he is known, with certainty, to have successfully recorded an image.
His process was publicized in 1840, and of all the other methods developed before 1841, it was Bayard’s that produced the best and most detailed images.
In 1838, after continuing the work of his associate, Niépce, the French painter and inventor Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre took an image of the Moon at the request of the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago.
Daguerre’s technique, which used copper plates coated with silver, was made known to the public in 1839 and the images were called "daguerreotypes".
It would become the most widely used method after 1840.
The German astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler came up with term "photography" in 1839 by combining "photo" (from the Greek word for light) and "graphy" (to write).
The word was quickly popularized by the British astronomer John Frederick William Herschel, who is often mistakenly given credit for inventing the word.
In 1840, the American doctor and chemist John William Draper produced a daguerreotype of the Moon: the first astronomical photograph ever created in North America.
The French optician Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours photographed the Sun for the first time in 1842, but no details were visible.
In 1850, two Americans – astronomer William Cranch Bond and photographer John Adams Whipple – produced the first photograph of a star when they made a daguerreotype of Vega (also known as Alpha Lyrae).
Also in 1850, the English inventor Frederick Scott Archer came up with the wet collodion process.
Collodion is a viscous (thick) liquid that Archer used to coat glass plates.
By producing a photographic negative on glass rather than on paper, the resulting images were much sharper and could be made much larger, hence the great interest for astronomers.
Archer published his technique in 1851 and astronomers rapidly adopted the use of photographic plates.
In 1857, using this method, George Phillips Bond of the United States was the first to photograph a double star (Mizar and Alcor).
In 1879, the American inventor George Eastman (who would go on to found the Eastman-Kodak company in 1892) built a machine for coating photographic plates with emulsion that allowed photographs to be produced in great quantity.
During the first few decades of the 1900’s, the Eastman Company worked in collaboration with several astronomical observatories to develop emulsions that were increasingly sensitive to light.
The photographic plate thus became the imaging medium par excellence in the 20th century.
Astrophotography experienced its golden age between the 1960’s and 1980.
Thanks to colour filters, images produced from photographic plates could also be presented in colours, which greatly increased the public’s interest in astronomy.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Filters Blocking some light to reveal more details In 1861, the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell created the first colour photograph.
He made the photo by first placing a black and white photographic plate behind a plate of red glass.
He then repeated the procedure with a green plate, and then blue.
He projected the three "negatives" on a screen using glass plates in the corresponding colours and thus obtained a colour image.
Today, we call Maxwell’s red, green and blue glass plates "filters".
A filter allows some colours to be blocked, which emphasizes the remaining colours that pass through.
By carefully choosing filters, it is possible to reveal details that would otherwise be difficult to see.
In 1878, Frederick Charles Luther Wratten of England founded one of the first companies to supply photographic material.
In 1909, he developed a system of number-coded colour filters that quickly became the standard in the photography industry.
The Eastman-Kodak Company bought Wratten’s company in 1912 and continued to use his filter system.
After acquiring Wratten’s company, Eastman-Kodak began to manufacture filters specifically designed for astronomy work.
The company continues to make them today and, surprisingly, still uses Wratten’s original numbering system.
The market is shared by other companies – like Lumicon, Meade and Orion – who also design filters for professional and amateur astronomers.
Some filters are designed to block out the artificial light of fluorescent and incandescent lighting; this serves to increase the contrast of many celestial objects.
Video sequence   Marie-Maude de Denus-Baillargeon explains what an optic filter is.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Photometers Measuring the brightness of celestial objects A photometer is an instrument that measures and quantifies the brightness of a celestial body (a galaxy, star, comet or planet, for example).
The brightness depends on the luminosity of the object and on the distance that separates the object from the photometer, as well as the amount of matter between the two that can obscure the object.
A very luminous star could appear dim if it is far enough away or is partly obscured by gaseous clouds and interstellar dust.
A photometer has several applications in astronomy.
In the case of a star, for example, a photometer can be used to determine its temperature, its distance and even its age.
Photometers can also be used to determine if planets are orbiting about certain stars.
Let’s take a look at the case of temperature.
A hot star will emit a lot of light in the blue portion of the spectrum (relatively energetic wavelengths), whereas a cold star will mainly emit red light (less energetic wavelengths).
By using a photometer to measure the amount of light emitted at blue and red wavelengths (that is, the "colour" of the star), temperature can be estimated.
The brightness of a celestial object is a measure of its luminous flux: the amount of incoming light.
The luminous flux of a star is dependent on a combination of temperature, the size of its surface, and its distance from Earth.
If we know its temperature (by its colour) and its distance (by other methods), we can calculate its surface area and thus its size.
Astronomers can use photometers to precisely measure the amount of light emitted at specific wavelengths that correspond to the emission lines produced by heated chemical elements.
This information is used to establish the chemical composition of a star.
Many different methods have been developed for estimating the brightness of celestial bodies.
All the initial attempts, however, had a major drawback: the estimate had to be made visually and could vary greatly from one observer to another.
In 1836, the British astronomer John Frederick William Herschel changed all that.
Herschel invented a photometer ("astrometer" as he called it) that allowed the observer to visually compare the brightness of stars using a scale based on the reduced telescopic image of the Moon.
It was the first true photometer.
In 1839, the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago proposed the design of a new photometer using photographic principles.
His goal was to eliminate the role played by the observer in determining the brightness of an object by rendering the technique completely objective.
In 1844, the French physicists Jean Bernard Léon Foucault and Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau conducted a series of experiments for Arago in which a photometer was coupled with a daguerreotype.
It took until 1885 for photographic plates to be systematically used in photometry.
It was in that year that the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn began to measure the brightness of 454,875 stars from the Southern Hemisphere.
The technique typically used at the time to determine an object’s brightness consisted of measuring its diameter on a photographic plate.
The more intense the brightness, the more the plate would react and the greater the diameter of the image.
The problem with this method is that if the light is too intense, the emulsion becomes saturated and stops reacting.
In 1910, the American astronomer Charles Edward Pickering found a solution to the problem of saturation: he proposed to measure the amount of light passing through the object’s image on the plate, rather than its diameter.
Many improvements have been made to photographic photometers during the 20th century.
Some of the most notable include the addition of an adjustable iris around a star’s image (1934), the complete automation of the procedure (1969), and the addition of a laser to increase the precision of the data (1971).
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Infrared cameras Photographing the invisible using infrared light In 1800, the German astronomer William Herschel was the first to discover that light is not always visible to the naked eye.
During an optical experiment, Herschel passed sunlight through a prism to separate the white light into its coloured components.
Using a thermometer, he measured the temperature of each of the coloured rays and determined that the temperature increased from blue to red.
Pushing his experiment a little bit further, Herschel placed the thermometer beyond the red light rays where no light was visible.
To his great surprise, he measured a temperature even higher than that within any of the visible rays.
He proved, for the first time ever, that invisible light – the infrared – exists beyond the red portion of the light spectrum.
In 1856, the Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth detected infrared light emanating from the Moon.
He conducted his observations at different elevations and realized that the best data had been collected at the highest elevations.
He was thus the first to understand that the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs some part of the infrared light coming from space.
Unfortunately, the composition of the collodion was not revealed and, for the next twenty years, all attempts to produce another infrared photograph failed.
The first publicly known infrared-sensitive chemical compound, dicyanine, was discovered in 1903.
One year later, the American physicist Robert Williams Wood recognized the possibility of improving the sensitivity of infrared photographic film using kryptocyanine emulsion, the chemical cousin of dicyanine.
He conducted experiments and, in 1910, became the first to publish photographs taken in the infrared (the photos were of scenery).
Knowing that the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs some of the infrared rays coming from space, astronomers (both amateurs and professionals) began to collect airborne data beginning in the 1930’s.
It was during one of these expeditions that the American Albert William Stevens used an infrared filter in 1932 to photograph a total eclipse of the Sun from an airplane at an altitude of 8,200 metres.
In 1933, an American, Auguste Piccard, used an infrared camera to photograph the Earth’s ozone layer from onboard the hot air balloon Century of Progress.  In 1942, the Eastman Kodak Company patented the first infrared-sensitive film that could produce photos using "false colours".
  Telescopes borne on rockets were first used to photograph the infrared sky in 1970.
The project, called Hi Star, was active until 1976 and managed to accumulate a total of 30 minutes of observation time.
In all, 2,363 infrared sources were detected.
The first infrared space observatory – IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite) – was launched in 1983 and operated for 10 months.
It mapped more than 96% of the sky and discovered about 500,000 infrared sources.
The ability of infrared light to pass through dust allowed the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, to be revealed for the first time.
A few years later, in 2003, the Spitzer space telescope was launched.
Spitzer is the "Rolls-Royce" of infrared telescopes and is used to study specific astronomical targets.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments CCD cameras Recording higher quality images without photographic film or plates A digital camera records images using a photosensitive cell called a charge-couple device (CCD).
A CCD is a thin layer of silicon divided into a multitude of small squares known as "picture elements", usually referred to in the shortened form of "pixels".
Each pixel is separated from the next by thin insulators.
To take a photo, the CCD is exposed to light: the same principle as taking a photo using a photographic film or plate.
When light strikes a pixel, however, the silicon produces an electric charge, and the greater the amount of light, the greater the charge.
When the exposure is finished, the camera’s microprocessor reads the charge on the pixels, row by row, and transforms the information into a digital image.
Exposing a CCD for two minutes can therefore reveal more details than is possible during a one-hour exposure using a conventional photographic plate.
Other than photography, CCDs are used in photocopiers, facsimile (fax) machines, scanners and barcode readers.
In 1969, two researchers at Bell Laboratories – the Americans Willard Boyle and George Smith – designed the basic structure of a CCD and defined its operating principles.
Several months later, they developed the first video camera to function with a CCD.
In 1973, the American company Fairchild Imaging developed their first commercial CCD.
Consisting of 100 x 100 pixels, it was used in 1974 to produce the first astronomical photo ever taken by a digital camera.
It consisted of an image of the Moon captured using a 20-centimetre telescope.
In 1976, Fairchild Imaging sold the first commercial CCD camera: the Fairchild MV-101.
In 1979, CCD cameras made their way into professional astronomy.
In 1983, the use of CCD cameras became much more widespread among professional observatories.
For the first time ever, it was possible to study celestial objects thousands of time paler than anything recorded on even the most sensitive photographic plates, putting a whole new face on the Universe.
Today, digital cameras are an integral part of the standard equipment in a professional observatory.
The largest, MegaCam (mounted on the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in 2006) uses a mosaic of 40 CCDs for a total of 340 million pixels.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Spectrometers Pulling light apart to extract information A spectrometer is an instrument that measures the properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
There are two types of spectrometers: spectroscopes and spectrographs.
A spectroscope transforms light into a spectrum using a prim that can be observed through a small telescope.
The positions of the lines reveal the chemical composition of the material in question.
In 1860, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati had the idea to combine a spectroscope with his telescope.
He studied the spectra of fifteen stars and published his results in 1863.
He was soon followed by the American astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, the Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi, and the amateur British astronomer William Huggins, all of whom worked independently on the Sun, planets, Moon and stars.
Rutherfurd and Secchi were the first to classify stars into groups according to their spectral characteristics.
In 1864, Donati was the first to clearly observe the spectrum of a comet (Comet 1864b).
That same year, Huggins and Miller succeeded in using spectroscopy to demonstrate that nebulas are clouds of gas, not stars.
As a result of these spectacular discoveries, spectroscopes were the focus of much developmental work and were continuously improved during the 1900’s.
Today, they are entirely automated and controlled by a computer, and the measurement of spectral lines is done using a photodetector.
A spectrograph operates like a spectroscope except that the small telescope is replaced by a detector that can record the spectrum of the material being studied.
The first spectrographs used a photographic camera as a detector.
It was the first photograph of our Sun’s spectrum.
The experiment was repeated in 1843 by the American doctor and chemist John William Draper.
In 1863, Huggins and Miller photographed the spectra of the Sirius and Capella stars using a wet collodion plate.
They thus obtained the first spectrogram (that is, the first spectral image) of a star other than the Sun.
Absorption lines were not visible, however, and the spectrum appeared continuous.
It was several years later, in 1872, that John William Draper would be the first to record the absorption lines of a star, in this case Vega.
The world of astronomy was revolutionized and astronomers applied themselves to spectroscopy in great numbers.
Today, 90% of our knowledge about stars has been possible thanks to spectroscopy.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Polarimeters Determining the direction of light waves to better understand stars and planets In 1669, the Danish physicist Rasmus Bartholin was the first to publish an article on the splitting of light rays by Icelandic spar, a very pure form of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate).
Without knowing it, he had discovered polarization – a very important property of light.
Unfortunately, without the benefit of a theory that could adequately explain the nature and behaviour of light, Bartholin was unable to deduce the origins of the phenomenon.
In 1678, the Danish physicist and astronomer Christiaan Huygens also observed the splitting of light by Icelandic spar calcite.
He presented an explanation in 1690 that was based on the presence of "ether" – a hypothetical substance that filled space – but it was quickly disputed.
Using this theory, physicists quickly understood that when a natural light source emits light, it generates a myriad of waves that oscillate in planes oriented in many different directions (see illustration).
Consequently, if we project light onto a screen pierced with numerous parallel slits, only the light waves with the same orientation as the slits will be able to pass through.
Only two years later, in 1811, the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago invented the polariscope, an instrument that can determine whether or not light is polarized.
Among other things, he discovered that lunar light is polarized.
The study of planet surfaces using polarimetry was significantly advanced by the French astronomer Bernard Ferdinand Lyot.
Working since 1920 at the Meudon Observatory near Paris, he submitted a doctoral thesis in 1929 on the polarization of light reflected from the surface of several planets.
Among his hypotheses was the suggestion that Mars experienced gigantic sandstorms – a prediction that would be confirmed by the Viking 1 probe in 1976.
Lyot died in 1952, but the astronomer Audouin-Charles Dollfus continued his worked at Meudon.
Dollfuss was the first to determine that the surface of Mars consists of iron oxides.
Today, Lyot and Dollfus are considered as the pioneers of planetary polarimetry.
In 1922, he revealed the polarized nature of the solar spectrum emitted by the Sun’s surface away from sunspots.
In 1946, the American astronomer Horace W. Babcock used polarimetry to identify, for the first time, a star other than the Sun that produces a magnetic field (the star was 78 Virginis).
In 1949, the American astronomers John Scoville Hall and William Albert Hiltner independently discovered that 1--3% of the light emitted by many stars is polarized.
In addition, a map of polarized light across the sky revealed large-scale structures of our galaxy.
At the time, the phenomenon and pattern of widespread polarization could not be explained.
The answer was not long in coming, however.
In 1950, the American astronomers Jesse Leonard Greenstein and Leverett Davis Jr. proposed that polarization of interstellar light is due to the presence of dust particles that are naturally aligned with the magnetic field of the galaxy.
The two researchers even developed models that used polarimetric data to detect interstellar magnetic fields produced by individual stars.
Today, polarimeters are used to detect magnetic fields and to study the atmosphere of the Sun and other stars, the surface and atmosphere of planets, the interstellar medium, and nebulas.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Interferometers Combining light rays to increase telescopic resolution In 1801, the British physicist Thomas Young demonstrated that light propagates as waves, like waves on the surface of water.
For example, if the crests (or troughs) of two light waves are coincident, they combine together to create an amplified wave in what is known as constructive interference.
This is destructive interference.
Between these two extremes lie an infinite number of variations in which crests and troughs combine together to intensify or dim the light.
In 1867, the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau proposed that the resolution of telescopes could be improved if the collected light signals were allowed to combine with each other via constructive interference.
Unfortunately, the technology of the day did not permit him to construct an instrument capable of combining light waves as they emerged from a telescope.
During the next sixty years, most studies in interferometry centred on the same type of work, such as measuring the diameter of a particular star, or determining the distance between the two suns in a double-star system.
In 1946, the British radio astronomer Martin Ryle, with the help of the physicist Derek D. Vonberg, constructed the first interferometer that could operate in the domain of radio waves.
This breakthrough allowed the two scientists to discover many new celestial objects.
In 1956, the British physicists and astronomers Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Quintin Twiss perfected their first interferometer using separate telescopes.
Operating in the visible light domain, their instrument was tested on several types of stars and the resolution of the images were unequalled by any other imaging method in existence.
The sharpness of the visible details in a normal image is limited by the diffraction of light waves as they pass through the telescope’s objective.
During the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, the arrival of more powerful computers made interferometry increasingly accessible to researchers.
In 1967, a group of nine Canadian researchers – led by the astronomer J. L. (Allen) Yen of the University of Toronto – jointly used the 46-metre radio telescope of the Algonquin Radio Observatory in Ontario, and the 26-metre radio telescope of the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in British Columbia, to simulate a giant radio telescope measuring 3,074 kilometres in diameter (the distance separating the two observatories).
It was the first successful long-distance interferometry experiment ever conducted.
In 1974, under the guidance of the American physicist (and future Nobel Laureate) Charles Hard Townes at the University Columbia in New York City, students Michael Allan Johnson, Albert L. Betz and Edmund Charles Sutton constructed the first infrared interferometer.
  That same year, the French astronomer Antoine Émile Henry Labeyrie developed the first interferometer that could operate in real time.
Prior to Labeyrie’s breakthrough, radiometric data was recorded on magnetic ribbon and sent to a laboratory to be processed.
Today, images with very high resolution are obtained using interferometers.
Local celestial objects have the greatest scientific potential and represent the best targets.
Laminar air currents can also be blown across the surface of the mirror to minimize turbulence.
The Earth’s atmosphere consists of layers of air at different temperatures that interact and cause large-scale movements of air masses (referred to as turbulence by scientists).
For astronomers, turbulence is detrimental to their work as it disrupts the trajectory of light rays.
This causes stars in the sky to twinkle and telescope images to be distorted.
A simple means to minimize the effects of this inconvenient phenomenon is to build astronomical observatories at high elevations so that the telescopes only peer through the upper levels of the terrestrial atmosphere.
The first research into resolving the problem of image distortion related to atmospheric turbulence was conducted in 1902 by the German physician Karl Strehl, who proposed a method of evaluating the image quality produced by optical systems.
In 1941, the Soviet mathematician Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov made several breakthroughs into the study of turbulence.
His work would later be integrated into atmospheric models used to correct distortions affecting astronomical images.
In 1953, the American astronomer Horace Welcome Babcock invented adaptive optics, a process that corrects image distortions caused by the terrestrial atmosphere.
The technique consists of taking a sample of the light received by the telescope and calculating its degree of distortion.
Deformable mirrors are then used to redirect the light rays and produce a corrected image.
The proposal was promising, but Babcock was not able to construct his system for technical reasons.
In 1957, the American physician Robert B. Leighton of the California Institute of Technology succeeded in reducing atmosphere-induced image distortions using the 1.5-metre telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California.
His technique consisted of inclining the telescope’s secondary mirror several times per second.
In so doing, he managed to obtain the best images ever recorded of Jupiter and Saturn.
In that same year, the Soviet physicist Vladimir Pavlovich Linnik published an article in which he proposed that an artificial "guide star" could be created by pointing a laser at the sky and targeting its focal point in the upper atmosphere to agitate gas molecules.
If an adaptive optics system uses a natural "guide star", it must be bright enough compared to the celestial object of interest to provide adequate light for the telescope’s detector.
The guide star and the study object must also appear sufficiently close in the sky.
It is not always easy to find a star that fulfills these criteria, hence the idea of creating an artificial guide star.
In 1970, the American engineer W. Thomas Cathey and his collaborators were the first to experimentally demonstrate an adaptive optics system that operated in real time.
Three years later, in 1973, another American engineer, John W. Hardy, built the first adaptive optics system intended for astronomy.
Originally designed to detect Soviet military satellites, the system used a deformable mirror.
Astronomers took advantage of the technique and new adaptive optics systems began to appear.
In 1977, the American physicist Andrew Buffington developed the first system to use a segmented mirror.
Each of the six segments is controlled by a piston that could adjust the inclination.
In 1981, the American physicist Robert Q. Fugate and his team began to work on a system that would use a laser to generate a guide star – the idea originally proposed by Linnik in 1957.
The first tests were performed in 1983 and 1984.
Since then, several adaptive optics systems have been equipped with a laser that operates on this principle.
In 1991, the American army been declassifying their confidential work on adaptive optics.
Upon accessing the documents, the astronomy community realized that they had already designed and constructed more powerful and less costly systems than those of the military.
As of 2005, 18 observatories and 26 large telescopes are equipped with image correction systems.
These systems are now considered as standard equipment for big observatories

Astronomers Light: a form of energy For us, light is an extraordinary phenomenon that illuminates our world and makes it visible.
What would we do without it?
Since we first opened our eyes, humans have worshipped the Sun as a god of light and a source of life and security.
The emergence of rational thought brought with it a need to question the nature of this phenomenon.
So what exactly is light?
Light is a form of energy produced by matter.
To understand how light is created, we must first take a look at atoms, the building blocks of matter.
In the world of atomic particles, the adage holds true that opposites attract and thus the nucleus and electrons are mutually attracted to each other within the atom.
Although an electron cannot randomly occupy positions within an atom, it can nonetheless change its distance from the nucleus by changing its energy level.
To do this, its energy content must be modified to match the energy level of the new orbit that it will enter.
For example, to move from a distant orbit into a closer orbit, the electron must eliminate some of its energy.
The energy released is partly electrical in nature and – as with all negatively charged bodies – partly magnetic.
This excess energy is released by the electron in the form of an energy packet known as a "photon".
A photon is an energy particle that has no mass and moves at high speed.
When a moving photon interacts with matter, it does so as a wave, like a wave moving across the surface of water.
These waves are known as "electromagnetic waves" because they display both electrical and magnetic components.
In fact, a photon can be thought of as a "particle of light" and an electromagnetic wave as a "lightwave".

Astronomers White light: a mix of colours In 1665, Francesco Maria Grimaldi, an Italian Jesuit priest, conducted a simple experiment the results of which went on to occupy the minds of several generations of physicists, including Newton and Einstein.
To his great surprise, Grimaldi found that the beam of light illuminating the screen was larger than expected.
Strangest of all, however, was that the light was no longer white, but became two or three rays of different colours.
Without knowing it, Grimaldi had conducted the first experiment into the splitting of light.
He assigned the term "diffraction" to the phenomenon, a term that survives to this day.
Grimaldi later realized that diffraction is a phenomenon that does not only occur when light is projected through a slit; instead, it occurs each time light strikes the edges of any object.
Several scientists were interested in the effect but none could explain it.
The answer was not long in coming, however, and it was Isaac Newton himself who would provide the explanation.
In 1662, Newton began his own optical experiments.
One of his first projects was to construct a refracting telescope.
He polished lenses and attempted to improve the instrument by getting rid of the coloured fringes that would appear on the margins of his images (he did not succeed and decided instead to develop a mirror-based reflecting telescope).
In 1666, during one of his optical experiments, Newton passed sunlight through a prism and split the light beam into different colours, like what he observed along the edges of his optical lenses.
Others before him had conducted similar experiments, but Newton was the first to understand that white light consists of a mix of light rays, each with a different colour.
Newton also understood that white light can be separated into its components because each ray of colour is deviated by the glass of the prism by a different amount.
He realized, for example, that red light is consistently less deviated than violet light.
This ordered separation of coloured rays is known as the "spectrum".
The spectrum of white light consists of six basic colours arranged in a specific order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.
Although Newton understood that a beam of light of a particular colour is always deviated by the same amount, he did not appear to understand why this is so.
More than a century would pass before another British scientist by the name of Thomas Young would provide part of the answer.

Astronomers …or the birth of spectroscopy In 1801, the physicist Thomas Young clearly demonstrated that light travels as a wave, much like the succession of crests and troughs along the surface of water.
One of Young’s most astonishing feats was that he succeeded in measuring the wavelengths of red and violet light; that is, the distance between two crests or troughs of successive waves.
His results revealed a wavelength of 7 thousandths of a millimetre for red light and 4 thousandths of a millimetre for violet.
Combining these measurements with the basic concepts of Newton’s work, he concluded that light with a longer wavelength is less deflected than light with a shorter wavelength.
During the same historic period, around 1802, the British chemist William Hyde Wollaston uncovered a surprising fact: the spectrum of sunlight is not continuous.
In fact, numerous black lines are superimposed on the colours of its spectrum.
Unfortunately, this revelation did not attract much attention and no ideas were advanced to explain their presence.
Several years later, in 1814, the German optician Josef von Fraunhofer noticed the same black lines in the spectrum of sunlight.
Although he did not understand their significance, he nonetheless measured their positions and catalogued a total of 324.
In 1859, the German chemist Robert Wilhelm Bunsen (who improved and popularized the burner that bears his name) devised an original analytical technique: he inserted mineral salts into the flame of his burner and observed the colours produced by the gas emitted.
He was thus able to determine whether a particular substance was present in a mineral by observing a colour that, according to him, characterized that substance.
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, a German physician and friend of Bunsen, proposed the additional step of dispersing the light emitted by the gas by using a prism.
The two researchers thus made a major discovery: each chemical element generates a series of spectral rays that uniquely characterize the substance, much like a fingerprint identifies a person.
The invention of tTheir new analytical technique, spectroscopy, led to the discovery of many new chemical elements in the years ahead.
Kirchhoff was interested in the spectrum of sunlight and realized that Fraunhofer’s black lines corresponded exactly to the bright rays emitted by specific chemical elements.
He deduced that the white light produced by the hot surface of the Sun was in part absorbed by certain chemical elements present in its cooler atmosphere, which produces black lines in the spectrum.
Kirchhoff’s discoveries opened the doors to spectroscopic studies in astronomy.
To their great satisfaction, astronomers were now equipped with a method for determining the chemical composition of stars and nebulas, and even their temperature, distance, speed and age by measuring the intensity of the different spectral rays and applying basic principles of physics.
It was through spectroscopy that light allowed us to "touch the stars", something long believed impossible due to the great distances involved.
One problem remained unanswered for Kirchhoff: he could not explain how matter could emit or absorb light.
Other researchers would help resolve this enigma 50 years later.
Astronomers A map of visible and invisible light Our understanding of the nature of light took a giant leap forward in the second half of the 1800’s with the help of the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell.
Maxwell was interested in a multitude of scientific problems that included electricity and magnetism.
He first published articles on these subjects in 1855, then compiled his work in 1873 into a book entitled Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which is now considered a classic in the field of matter.
In 1863, Maxwell discovered that by manipulating equations for electricity and magnetism, it was possible to extract a value that corresponded to the speed of light.
Surprised by this result, he began to suspect that light, electricity and magnetism were one and the same.
To follow up on this idea, he developed new equations for electricity and magnetism and concluded that not only is light a wave – as demonstrated by Thomas Young more than 50 years earlier – but an electromagnetic wave.
The discovery that light possesses both electric and magnetic components proved to be of paramount importance.
Maxwell went on to reason that invisible electromagnetic waves exist beyond the visible and ultraviolet light spectra, but sadly he did not live long enough to test his idea.
Hertz labelled these new waves "radio waves", and their discovery was put to beneficial use in the development of the telegraph and the radio.
Today, the electromagnetic spectrum is known to extend far beyond the colours of the rainbow, as shown in the diagram below.
The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see with our eyes is tiny with respect to its full extent.
If the electromagnetic spectrum was a window 30 million kilometres long, we would only have to open it three centimetres to let in all the visible light.
The electromagnetic spectrum is continuous but scientists have divided it in an artificial manner for practical reasons.
The divisions were mainly established by the limitations of the various techniques used to detect wavelengths.
For example, the limits of the visible light range is defined by what our eyes can detect.
Although other electromagnetic waves – radio waves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma rays – represent "colours" that are invisible to us, they are nonetheless forms of light.

Astronomers When matter produces light All material, when hot, will emit light.
Everyday examples abound: the stove element in the kitchen, the metal filament in a lightbulb, and even the Sun.
By the end of the 1800’s, scientists were observing this phenomenon in their laboratories but could not explain it.
Despite this lack of understanding, they nonetheless knew how to separate the light emitted by a gas into a spectrum that was diagnostic of the chemical elements contained in the gas.
In 1859, the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff called this type of spectrum an "emission spectrum".
Many researchers attempted to explain how matter could generate an emission spectrum but without success.
It was only in 1900 that the German physicist Max Planck would provide part of the answer.
Planck noted that it was impossible to solve the problem using existing principles of physics and proceeded to develop a revolutionary theory that marked nothing less than the beginning of modern physics.
In his theory, Planck maintained that light could only be emitted as small packets of energy that he named "quanta" (later known as "photons").
This proposal ran contrary to all contemporary knowledge about light at that time.
In fact, light was considered to be a continuous form of energy that propagated as an electromagnetic wave and not – as Planck proposed – as a form of discontinous energy in the form of particles, like photons.
The debate finally came to a head – and to a resolution – when the German physicist Albert Einstein entered the scene in 1905.
Einstein not only supported Planck’s idea, he went one step further: he proposed that light behaved as a particle (a photon) but also retained its wave character and must therefore be considered as both a particle and a wave.
Furthermore, Einstein established that the energy of a photon is related to the wavelength of the radiation.
He concluded that waves with long wavelengths, like red light, transport small amounts of energy, whereas those with short wavelengths, like violet light, transport more energy.
In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr integrated the advances of Planck and Einstein into his new model of the atom to explain how matter could emit light in the form of particles.
According to Bohr, the atom consists of negatively charged electrons that orbit around a positively charged nucleus.
The model further specified that electrons orbit the nucleus at well defined distances from the nucleus.
An electron orbiting near the nucleus has relatively little energy because it is held in its orbital by the strong attractive force exerted by the nucleus.
Energy must be added to this electron for it to "jump" to a higher orbital, and the further away it jumps, the more energy it would need.
An electron in a starting position that is farther from the nucleus already has more energy because it must compensate for the great distance that separates it from the nucleus.
Less energy would thus be needed to make this electron jump to a higher level compared to an electron that started closer to the nucleus.
According to Bohr, when a material is heated, some of the electrons in orbitals near the nucleus will absorb enough energy to allow them to jump to new orbital levels at great distance from the nucleus.
The electrons, however, will eventually return to their original orbitals; when they do so, they must release enough energy so that their energy content again matches the energy level of the original orbital.
Given the basic principle that the atomic nucleus of each chemical element has a positive charge different from that of any other element, its electron orbitals must also have distinctive energy contents since the electrons must balance the charge of the nucleus.
The energy given off by an electron when dropping from a distant orbital to a closer orbital will thus be a photon with a characterisitc amount of energy and a corresponding wavelength in the emission spectrum.
If the atoms of a given element have a combination of possible orbital jumps that is different from the combinations possible for the atoms of other elements, then every element will display its own unique emission spectrum.
The following diagram shows the emission spectra for various elements.
Notice how the emission lines are diagnostic, much like a bar code or a fingerprint.
Emission spectra of hydrogen.
Emission spectra of iron.
In astronomy, this phenomenon is often observed when white light, no matter what its source (the surface of the Sun or another star, for example) passes through a thin cloud of gas or dust.
In this case, instead of seeing a continuous spectrum from red to violet, astronomers will observe a spectrum in which several rays of colour are missing and dark lines take their place.
It was around 1802 that the British chemist William Hyde Wollaston noticed for the first time that the spectrum from the Sun displays just this type of effect.
The solar spectrum is discontinuous with numerous dark lines occuring among the coloured bands.
At the time, Wollaston did not understand why this is so.
In 1814, the German optician Josef von Fraunhofer also noticed these same dark lines in the spectrum of sunlight.
Although he also failed to understand their significance, he nonetheless measured and documented the positions of 324 lines.
It was only in 1859 that the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff understood that Fraunhofer’s dark lines corresponded exactly to the bright lines emitted by certain known elements.
According to him, the dark lines represented specific chemical elements that are present within the Sun’s atmosphere but are absorbing certain spectral rays emitted by the Sun’s surface.
Kirchhoff named this type of spectrum an "absorption spectrum".
Unfortunately, he did not understand at the time how matter could absorb spectral rays.
In 1860, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati had the idea of attaching a spectroscope to his telescope.
He studied the spectrum of fifteen or so stars and published his results in 1863.
He was followed in 1862 by the amateur British astronomer William Huggins, the American astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, and the Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi, all of whom independantly worked on the Sun, the planets, the Moon and the stars.
These researchers began a scientific revolution by being the first to extract information from the light emitted by stars.
They were quickly followed by other astronomers, and the study of emission spectra became the main field of study in astronomy.
Despite considerable progress, the explanation of how light could be absorbed by matter still eluded the scientists of the time.
The Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr finally provided the answer in 1913.
Bohr developed a new model of the atom consisting of negatively charged electrons that occupy specific orbitals around a positive nucleus.
According to Bohr, the farther the electron orbital is positioned from the nucleus, the higher its energy content in order to compensate for the great distance to the nucleus and its attractive force.
When a cool material is heated, some of the electrons will jump from low energy orbitals near the nucleus to more distant and higher energy orbitals.
To do this, each electron must increase its energy content to exactly match the energy level of the new orbital it will occupy.
Bohr proposed that electrons absorb this extra energy in the form of "energy packets" as described by Planck and Einstein.
The same type of phenomenon occurs in space when the light emitted from the surface of a star (like the Sun) shines through the cooler gases in the atmosphere surrounding it.
The atmosphere absorbs part of the white light emitted from the star, which produces a colour spectrum marked by dark lines (absorption lines) that are characteristic of the elements present in the gas.
The study of a star’s spectrum thus gives us information about the chemical composition of its atmosphere.
Astronomers The astronomer’s unit for measuring distance In astronomy, distances between celestial objects – like stars and galaxies – are very large.
For example, the distance that separates us from out closest neighbour, the Moon, is on average 385,000 kilometres.
The Sun, on the otherhand, is on average 150 million kilometres away, and the next closest star is Proxima Centauri at 40,000 billion kilometres.
To avoid manipulating such long numbers on a regular basis, a unit of distance better adapted to the scale of the Universe quickly became a necessity.
One unit of distance commonly used in astronomy is the light-year.
A light-year is the distance travelled by light in one year, which is 9 trillion, 460 billion, 730 million, 472 thousand and 581 kilometres.
It was first necessary to determine the speed of light in order to know the distance that it will travel in one year.
Before 1676, most scientists thought that light moved instantaneously from one point to another.
In that year, however, the Danish physicist Ole Christensen Rømer was the first to demonstrate that light had a finite speed.
In 1671, Rømer began to observe the satellites of Jupiter and decided to measure the time it took for one of the moons (particularly Io) to disappear behind the giant planet and reappear on the other side.
By accumulating data for many years, he determined that the time separating the eclipses was shorter when the Earth was closer to Jupiter and longer when it was at a greater distance.
In 1675, the French astronomer Jean-Dominique Cassini, for whom Rømer was an assistant, proposed that the difference was due to the time it took light to travel from Jupiter to Earth.
However, he quickly changed his mind and abandoned the hypothesis.
Rømer, on the other hand, continued to pursue the idea and estimated that light takes 22 minutes to travel a distance equal to the diameter of the Earth’s orbit (we know today that the true value is closer to 16 minutes and 40 seconds).
If Rømer had calculated the speed of light using his data, he would have come up with an answer of 135,000 kilometres per second, which is about half the accepted value today of 299,792 kilometres per second.
The main source of error would have been the diameter of Earth’s orbit, which was not well known at the time.
It was only in 1729 that the majority of the astronomical community were finally convinced that light had finite speed.
The British astronomer James Bradley published a study demonstrating that the annual variation observed in the position of the stars is related to the speed of light.
He estimated that light travels at 301,000 kilometres per second, which is very close to the accepted value.
In 1838, the German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (and not the Scottish astronomer Thomas Henderson, as is often mentioned) was the first to use the light-year as a unit of measurement in astronomy.
He measured the distance separating us from the binary star 61 Cygni as 10.3 light-years.
The advantage of the light-year as a unit of measurement is not only that it quantifies distance, but that it also provides the time it takes for light to reach Earth.
For example, if 61 Cygni is 10.3 light-years from Earth (97,445,523,867,584 kilometres), then it takes it’s light 10.3 years to reach us.
We are therefore always seeing 61 Cygni as it was more than 10 years ago.
This is how light allows us to "see into the past" and why a telescope is really a type of "time travel machine".
This concept applies equally to very distant galaxies that are measured at distances of 10 to 12 billion light-years: they appear to us now the way they existed 10 to 12 billion years ago, only a short time after the Big Bang.

Astronomers When stars disappear… One of the negative effects of industrialization on human activity and the environment is the production of excessive light.
It may seem strange, but excess light is a form of pollution, particularly at night.
The negative effects of light pollution impact many fields of study, including economics, ecology and, of course, astronomy.
Most people do not consider the surplus of artificial light as a form of pollution because it is not permanent; all we must do is collectively turn out our lights to make it disappear.
In reality, however, such a solution is unrealistic because our society needs artificial light to function.
Light pollution is mainly caused by lighting systems that are misdirected, excessive, inefficient or unnecessary.
Most light pollution is found in urban settings where artificial light sources are numerous.
In these areas, light sources may be partly directed towards the sky, or downward directed light may be reflected upward.
Light is then dispersed by layers in the atmosphere and produces a glow that diminishes the darkness of the night sky.
In large Canadian cities, more than 95% of stars that can normally be seen with the naked eye are no longer visible.
Unexpected negative effects From bacteria to the stars The negative effects of light pollution on human activity are numerous.
From an economic point of view, for example, the use of excessive lighting or unnecessary lighting constitutes a waste of energy that is costly to both the individual and to industries.
In Quebec, the cost of "lighting the sky" is estimated at 45 million dollars per year.
On a larger scale, excessive lighting can have an impact on global climate change if the required electricity was generated by burning fossil fuels.
Wildlife and plants are also affected.
For example, nighttime lighting can confuse animals that migrate (like moths and migratory birds), can modify predator-prey relationships, and can even alter competitiveness within the same species.
In the case of moths, for example, it was discovered that numerous flowering plants declined in numbers when the flight paths of pollinating moth species were affected by light pollution.
It is even possible for entire ecosystems to be affected.
In lakes, for example, zooplankton may stop feeding on algae if nighttime lighting is too strong.
This leads to oxygen depletion in the lake, and many species of invertebrates and fish then die by asphyxiation.
In astronomy, light pollution is a real and pressing problem.
It diminishes the contrast between the dark sky and celestial sources of light, which makes it harder to see the stars.
For the amateur astronomer, it is a major problem because access to a truly dark sky is increasingly difficult to find.
The increasing inaccessibility of the starry sky is unfortunate because it has become evident that amateur astronomy plays an important role in the development of scientific interest among young people.
In 2003, the British government even acknowledged the link between a reduced interest in the sciences and an increase in light pollution!
For professional astronomers, artificial light is undesirable because it interferes with the collection of data.
This is why new observatories are built in isolated regions.
A number of amateur astronomy associations are also involved in protecting our endangered legacy, the starry night sky.
The focus of light pollution abatement programs is to change the habits of the general population, companies and urban planners so that less artificial light will be wasted or misdirected.
The plans typically revolve around three lines of action.
The first consists of using lighting equipment that properly directs light where it is required, and not to the sides or towards the sky.
The third is to use an appropriate level of lighting and to only light when necessary.
Your turn to get involved!

Astronomers The Amerindians The Inuit The Amerindians Stars were an integral part of their lives Before the arrival of Europeans, the Amerindians of Canada saw the starry sky as a place full of characters and stories.
Many of the peoples believed that everything found in nature was a living entity, even celestial objects like the Moon, the Sun and the stars.
In the Amerindian belief system, the Earth is flat and the celestial objects revolve around it.
The planets in the solar system are not thought of as planets, but rather as large stars that are simply brighter than the rest.
The Sun and other stars are seen as lights that move across a solid celestial canopy.
For the majority of Amerindian societies, each star is a spirit – a powerful and sacred being.
The Iroquois even oriented their long houses according to the four cardinal directions so that the Sun would shine onto the entrance at dawn, and set in the direction of the exit.
The Amerindians grouped many of the stars into constellations, and most of these are associated with stories that serve as a lesson to youngsters.
Some of the constellations, like Pleiades or the Great Bear, were also used to mark the seasons.
This is the case for one of the Mi’kmaq legends of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
One spring day, Mother Bear woke up after hibernating through the winter.
Being very hungry, she immediately began to look for food.
Chickadee, who was also very hungry, decided to hunt Mother Bear.
Too little to hunt on his own, he got six of his friends to help.
After hunting all spring and all summer, the slowest and heaviest hunters beginning with the two owls flew lower and lower until they eventually lost the trail of Mother Bear.
Blue Jay and Pigeon were the next to abandon the chase.
Completely covered in blood, he shook himself near the trees of the forest, colouring them red.
That is why, since then, the leaves of the trees turn a vivid red colour in autumn.
As much as he tried, Robin was never able to remove all the blood that stained his chest, and he still wears his red marks today.
The three friends ate Mother Bear and left her skeleton there.
During the winter, the spirit of Mother Bear left the sky and came to rest within another sleeping bear.
The bear awoke the next spring and Chickadee and his friends hunted her too until they killed her in autumn.
The story has repeated itself every year since then.
This legend reveals how the change in position of the Great Bear constellation in the sky serves to mark the beginning of autumn.
The Amerindian societies in Canada used a lunar calendar of 10 months with 30 days in each month.
Amerindian legends Dreamlike celestial stories The North Star, which remains in a fixed position in the sky, was well known to Amerindian peoples.
The following legend describes its origin according to the Blackfoot of Alberta:
Two sisters sleeping outside woke before dawn and looked up at the sky.
One of them pointed towards the Morning Star (Venus) and said, "That star is so beautiful, I will take it as a husband."
Several days later, the same young woman came across a handsome stranger in the forest while she was carrying wood.
He was observing her, so she asked him, "What do you want from me?"
The young man replied, "I am Morning Star.
You wanted me as your husband, so here I am."
He placed a feather in her hair and asked her to close her eyes.
He flew her up to the sky, into Sky Country.
"You may use this tool to harvest vegetables in our garden, but you must never touch the sacred turnip.
If you do, it will bring misfortune."
Time passed by and the woman gave birth to a baby.
To her surprise, she found that she could see her tribe and old home through the hole left by the turnip.
Be careful, for he must not touch the ground for 14 days or he will return to me and become a star."
Unfortunately, what should not have happened did, and the child was forced to return to the Sky Country.
But as he tried to pass through the hole left by the sacred turnip, the child became stuck.
And that is why, to this day, there is a star that does not move across the sky.
In some cases, the same celestial constellation is the subject of legends in more than one Amerindian society.
For example, two tribes in Canada have stories about the constellation Pleiades.
This one is from the Iroquois of Ontario.
Many years ago, an Iroquois tribe began the trek toward their winter hunting grounds near a large lake in southeastern Canada.
Upon their arrival, tribe members hurried to set up camp and tackle their chores.
Eight children, tired of helping their parents, would gather together each day away from the tribe to dance for several hours.
He was covered from head to toe with a coat of shiny white feathers and said to them, "If you do not stop, misfortune will come your way."
The children did not listen and continued to take longer and longer breaks during which they never stopped dancing.
Day after day, the old man came to warn them until one evening, the children suddenly found themselves rising up into the air.
The old man shook his head and thought, "If only they would have listened to me."
Not long after, the people of the village saw the children floating high in the sky.
One of the children recognized his Father’s voice and stopped dancing, but quickly fell like a shooting star to the ground.
Seven brothers living alone in the Northern Plains passed their time looking for their parents.
Always on the move, they were looking for food and a new shelter to sleep in.
Tired of such a miserable life, the youngest among them, who was playing with a spider’s web, said, "Why not transform ourselves into something else?
"Don’t be stupid," another replied.
"Rocks can be broken."
"What about trees?
Trees don’t break – they bend with the wind," said one of the brothers.
"Even the greatest trees can be uprooted by wind and storms," argued another.
"Why not take on the form of Night?
Night is never destroyed!" exclaimed one of the brothers.
"Night is scared of light, and runs away when Day arrives," replied another.
"Then why not change into stars?" asked the wisest of the brothers.
"They live in the sky and never die."
The seven brothers thought that was the best idea.
The youngest helped each of his brothers climb into the sky using the spider’s web.
He put three of them to his left, and three to his right.
He then took his place in the middle, and there they remain to this day.
Astronomers The Amerindians The Inuit The Inuit Their knowledge of the stars helped them navigate in a hostile environment where reference points are few and far between The Inuit peoples living in the Canadian Far North can view the dark night sky continuously for long periods of time.
At the North Pole, for example, the Sun rises and sets only once each year.
Contrary to popular belief, however, the polar night does not last for six months each year; instead, it lasts for four and a half months.
The difference is due to the tilt of the Earth, which causes dawn and twilight to last for several weeks at the poles, thus shortening the duration of the true polar night by six weeks each year.
Nonetheless, four and a half months is still a remarkably long night, and one might think that the peoples of the Arctic would have built up an extensive astronomical knowledge base.
This, however, does not appear to have been the case.
The time during which the northern peoples have access to the starry night sky is actually much shorter than four and a half months, even for the Inuit who live closest to the North Pole.
Clouds and aurora borealis also mask the stars.
Finally, the intense nighttime cold makes observation physically difficult.
As such, the Inuit have only two and a half months per year to observe the starry sky if we take into account the presence of the Moon, and only two months per year if we take into account the other factors.
All in all, the peoples of the North have difficult conditions to deal with and only a short period of time for studying the stars.
The ancient Inuit believed the Earth (Nunarjuaq in the Inuktitut language) to be a flat and stationary body around which celestial objects revolved.
It occupied the centre of their universe.
The Moon (Taqqiq) was seen as a flat disk of ice, and the Sun (Siqniq) as a ball of fire.
The disappearance of the Sun below the horizon for several months was taken as a sign that the cold and frost of winter had weighed it down so much that it could no longer lift itself into the sky.
The planets of the solar system were seen as large stars, and the distant stars as holes in the celestial dome.
Interestingly, the existence of the North Star – the polar star that remains in a fixed position in the sky and around which all the other stars appear to revolve – appears to have been unknown to the peoples of the North.
Only 33 stars were familiar to the ancient Inuit and only six or seven of them were given names.
Among them were several that were used for navigation during their travels.
As for the other stars, they were grouped into 16 constellations, most of which were associated with myths in which humans and animals played central roles.
Four men were hunting a bear.
The bear escaped by climbing into the sky and the hunters decided to follow it.
As they climbed higher and higher, one of the Inuit lost a mitten and decided to return to Earth to fetch it.
The other hunters continued their hunt in the sky and we can still see them today climbing after the bear in single file.
The Inuit measure the passage of time by using the arrival of the full moon, and their lunar calendar thus has 13 months.
The year begins at different times for each Inuit society depending on their latitude, although the signal that marks the New Year is the same for each tribe: it is the moment when the Sun reappears above the horizon after the long polar night.
This, of course, explains why the timing varies according the tribe’s northern location.
One such story from the Inuit of the Canadian Central Arctic tells how light first appeared on Earth:
In the beginning, darkness was everywhere.
There was no light on Earth, and it was not possible to see the ground, the animals or humans.
Strangely enough, however, an animal could transform into a human, and a human into an animal.
There were several different animals, like bears, hares and foxes, but when these animals became human, they all became the same: they spoke the same language, lived in the same style of home, and hunted the same way.
It was during this time that magic words were created.
A word mentioned casually during a conversation could suddenly acquire magical powers, and nobody could explain how or why.
One day, a fox and a hare were having an argument.
The fox kept repeating "Darkness!" because he liked the way he could use the dark to steal the hunting catches of the humans.
The hare, on the other hand, kept repeating "Daylight!" because he needed light to help him find food.
Since then, night and day take turns shining over Earth, and the fox and the hare take turns finding food as well.
For the Inuit, the Sun is generally seen as a woman, and the Moon as a man.
A long time ago, after the World was created, a great shaman acquired such strong powers that he went to live in the sky.
The brother and sister lived in harmony for a long time until a great disagreement arose between them and the brother hit the sister, marking her face with a disfiguring burn.
The young woman left her brother to take refuge elsewhere in the sky where she became the Moon.
Since then, the brother and his fire have followed her, trying to reach her, but never succeeding.
The following is one example from the Inuit of Canada’s Eastern Arctic:
A powerful angakoq (shaman) decided to visit the Moon.
At his request, his hands were tied with a leather cord and the lamps in his home were extinguished.
The shaman then prayed to his tormaq (spirit guide) to transport him to the Moon, and the spirit complied.
Once he arrived, he realized that the Moon was a house.
He entered and saw a beautiful woman, the Sun, to his left who asked him to put out the lamp in front of her.
It is important that you do not laugh, or misfortune will come your way."
The couple began to dance before the shaman.
To his great surprise, he saw that the Sun-Woman had no back, no spine and no entrails; only a heart and lungs occupied her chest.
The dance was very strange and the faces made by the couple so peculiar that the shaman ran away lest he should laugh.
Soon after, the shaman decided to return to the house, determined not to laugh.
Once the dance had ended, the Moon-Man graciously welcomed him and invited him to visit his home.
In one room, the shaman saw large herds of deer that roamed over vast plains.
In another room, he saw many pods of seals swimming in the ocean.
The Moon-Man let the shaman choose one of each as a gift.
The shaman told them his story of what he had seen on the Moon.
The Moon-Man is often seen as a strong and fair spirit.
This legend from the Inuit of Labrador is one such example:
A young orphan lived with a family that treated him badly.
He slept in the entrance tunnel with the dogs and ate only leftovers.
Only the youngest of the Girls in the home treated him well.
One night, while he lay on the ground staring up at the Moon, he thought of ways to escape.
The more he stared at the Moon, the more convinced he became the he was staring at a human face.
He was so certain the face was real that he pleaded to the Moon-Man to help him escape.
The Moon-Man heard him and descended to Earth.
He took the young orphan with him onto the beach where he flogged him with a whip.
With each crack of the whip across his body, the boy became stronger and bigger.
In the morning, the boy returned to the house and struck down all those who had been cruel to him, with the exception of the kind young Girl.
She became his wife, and he became the leader of the village.
After all, it is only natural for humans to wonder how far our planet lies from the Moon, the Sun and other celestial bodies.
The ancients believed that this distance was not very far at all: they saw the stars as being fixed upon a nearby celestial dome.
Over the course of time, however, astronomers began to realize that the size of the Universe is much greater than anyone had ever imagined.
Today we know it is so big its limits remain unknown.
In the 3rd century B.C., the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos calculated the Earth–Moon and Earth–Sun distances using the angle between the Moon and the Sun at the first quarter moon.
His method—based on imprecise data available at the time—estimated that the distance to the Sun is about 20 times the distance to the Moon.
Although we now know that the Sun is really about 400 times the distance to the Moon, Aristarchus’ estimate was nonetheless revolutionary because it suggested that the Sun was much more distant than previously believed.
Several decades later, another Greek astronomer, Hipparcus of Nicea, performed an amazing scientific feat by calculating the Earth–Moon distance with an error of less than 10%.
He did this using the time it takes for the Moon to pass through the shadow of the Earth during a lunar eclipse, and by applying his own ingenious geometric calculations.
Hipparcus also relied on the work of Eratosthenes of Cyrene who had fairly accurately estimated the diameter of the Earth to be 42,000 km (the real diameter is about 40,000 km).
Even more precise parallax measurements would have to wait until the development and improvement of astronomical instruments.
In fact, it was almost two millennia later in 1672 when Jean-Dominique Cassini, a French astronomer of Italian origin, and Jean Richer, a French astronomer, used more modern equipment to precisely measure the average Earth–Sun distance (also known as an "astronomical unit").
Their method relied on simultaneous observations of Mars from Paris and French Guyana.
The honour of being the first to measure the distance to a star other than the Sun must be given to the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel.
In 1838, he calculated the distance to 61 Cygni as 11 light-years from Earth.
These days, astronomers have several methods for measuring distances.
For objects within the Milky Way, most methods employ the method of parallax.
Another method for measuring galactic distances uses Type 1a supernovae: stars that generate constant amounts of energy after their supernova explosion.
They can be thought of as a "bomb standard": an explosion of known strength and luminosity.
Their apparent brightness in the sky is thus a measure of how far away they are from Earth.
Although these types of methods for measuring astronomical distances have allowed scientists to estimate the extent of the Universe, the sheer scale of it is mind-boggling.
It is somewhat easier to visualize such vast distances if we begin by imagining something smaller, like our own solar system.
The solar system consists of the Sun, planets that revolve around the Sun, and millions of smaller bodies.
The Oort Cloud, a vast reservoir of comets that circle the Sun, marks the outer limit of the solar system.
The distance to this boundary is about 1.6 light-years (recall that each light-year is almost 10,000 billion kilometres).
If you can imagine Pluto—the smallest and farthest of our solar system’s planets—as the same size as the head of a pin measuring 1 millimetre across, then the Sun would be as big as two 30-centimetre beach balls lying side by side 2.6 kilometres away from the head of the pin.
Our solar system lies in the Milky Way spiral galaxy.
At this scale, the size of our own solar system is quite insignificant.
In fact, if our entire 1.6-light-year solar system could sit on the head of a pin, the rest of our galaxy would be the size of a hockey rink!
The Milky Way is bunched together with more than 35 other galaxies to form a galaxy cluster known as the Local Group.
The largest member, the Andromeda galaxy, is visible in a moonless night sky without light pollution.
The other galaxies in the group, like the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud, are typically smaller than the Milky Way.
The Local Group occupies an area with a diameter of about 10 million light-years and a centre lying somewhere between the Milky Way and Andromeda.
If you can once again imagine the solar system as a head of a pin and our galaxy as a hockey rink, then the entire Local Group would measure 6.25 kilometres across.
The giant Virgo galaxy cluster marks the centre of the Local Supercluster at a distance of 50 million light-years.
The Virgo Cluster contains a "cannibal" galaxy at its centre—M87—that draws in and absorbs neighbouring galaxies.
Galaxy superclusters appear to be grouped together along long filaments that stretch out for hundreds of millions of light-years.
They are separated by immense voids that contain very few galaxies.
The size of these virtually empty spaces is truly incredible—on the order of 100 million light-years.
This grand-scale pattern defines the Universe across a distance of about 13 billion light-years.
As much as we try, we cannot directly observe what lies beyond that distance.
Astronomers Space Time The arrangement of matter Time The Universe existed in a highly compressed state more than 13 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since For a long time, scientists thought that the Universe was immutable—that it was unchanging over time and stars were the very essence of eternity.
It was only during the 20th century that scientists realized that this belief is false, and that the cosmos changes even on human time scales.
In other words, the Universe did not always display the same structure it does today.
It evolved over time, and thus it has a history.
This fascinating history began just over 13 billion years ago with a great explosion known as the Big Bang.
The Big Bang theory was first presented in 1927 by the Belgian astronomer and priest George Henri Lemaître.
Using Einstein’s theory of relativity combined with astronomical observations, Lemaître demonstrated that the Universe is expanding.
Although the Big Bang theory was not well received by Einstein and his colleagues, it is now widely accepted in scientific circles.
The turning point came in 1929 when American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble published a short article in which he demonstrated that galaxies are moving away from each other: it was an idea that supported the expanding Universe theory of Lemaître.
Another source of support for Lemaître’s theory came almost 20 years later in 1948 when an American physicist of Ukrainian origin, George Gamow, began to publish alone, and then with colleagues, a series of articles describing the events that took place during the first few moments after the Big Bang explosion.
According to Gamow, the Universe was like an extremely hot "energy soup" that rapidly cooled enough to allow the first atomic nuclei of hydrogen and helium to form.
Gamow’s work thus explained the long-standing mystery of why the Universe contains 99% hydrogen and helium.
Gamow and his colleagues proposed that a glow permeated the early Universe when those first atoms were created, and that even today—13 billion years later—we should be able to detect this residual glow as radio waves from across the Universe.
The world of astronomy was in for a remarkable revelation in 1965 when American physicists Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson somewhat serendipitously detected a weak radio signal coming from all directions of the cosmos at once: the famous cosmic background radiation predicted by Gamow.
Penzias and Wilson went on to receive the 1978 Nobel Prize for Physics for their discovery that helped prove the Big Bang theory.
The dramatic early moments of the Universe can be summed up as follows:
In the beginning, the Universe we observe today was concentrated into a single minuscule point.
It was only once it exploded simultaneously in all directions during a tiny fraction of a second that space was created and time began to flow.
Our current understanding of the beginning of the Universe starts 10 millionths of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second (10-43 seconds) after the Big Bang.
The Universe expanded somewhat slowly at this point, but its temperature was extraordinarily high: at least 100,000 billion billion billion (1032) degrees.
The cooling rate was extremely rapid, however, and only 100 billionth of a second later, its temperature had already dropped to 100 billion (1011) degrees!
A spectacular event then occurred: the size of the Universe abruptly multiplied by 1050 times (that’s 100 billion trillion trillion, or a 1 followed by 50 zeroes).
The Universe was still extremely hot so the particles were much too agitated to combine with each other and form atoms.
All this would change 300,000 years after the Big Bang when the temperature of the Universe had fallen to a mere 3,000 degrees.
At this temperature, the movements of subatomic particles were sufficiently slow that the first atoms could finally form.
Electrons—which up to this point had been spending their existence capturing and releasing photons—were now tied up with atomic nuclei (protons and neutrons) to create these first atoms.
Finally freed from their struggle with the electrons, photons began to move throughout space to create the earliest light energy: cosmic background radiation.
Video sequence   Hubert Reeves explains that the Universe has a history.
Astronomers Space Time The arrangement of matter The arrangement of matter As the Universe cooled, matter became more complex After the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe continually dropped as matter organized itself into increasingly complex forms.
At the grand scale, the cosmos was initially filled with a homogenous gas consisting mainly of light chemical elements.
At long last, the Universe ceased to be dark as it began to fill with stars that would eventually combine to form galaxies.
It was in the core of these first stars (and all stars since then) that heavier chemical elements—like carbon, oxygen, silicon and iron—began to form via nuclear reactions.
At the end of each star’s life cycle, these "new" chemical elements were released into space where they enriched the clouds of interstellar gas.
Gravitational forces eventually regrouped the matter in these clouds to create a new generation of stars.
The life cycle of stars is responsible for adding all kinds of chemical elements to the Universe.
Under very special conditions, it is even possible for atoms in the space between stars to combine with other atoms and form simple molecules, or even complex molecules like amino acids.
Some stars gain planets after being born.
Planets can be terrestrial (that is, made mainly of metal and rock like the Earth and Mars), whereas others are made mostly of gases, like Jupiter and Saturn, or ice, which is probably the case for Pluto.
The Earth is a peculiar case because water can exist in liquid form.
Thanks to this simple fact, it was possible for organic molecules (those consisting of carbon atoms) to arrange in complex enough patterns to allow life to form.
Although we are fairly certain that life began on Earth at least 3 billion 800 years ago, we still know very little about the conditions that allowed life to originate.
Astronomers Equipment and preparation How does a star finder work?
Equipment and preparation Astronomy is both a science and a pastime that can be practiced using only basic equipment and without being an expert The rewards of astronomy were never more accessible than they are today.
The recent profusion of spectacular images, the explosion of knowledge and technical possibilities, the ubiquitous presence of the Internet, and the widespread accessibility to equipment have catapulted popular astronomy into a new era.
Astronomy can be practiced during the day or night.
In the daytime, it is possible to observe the Moon, several planets, and our own star, the Sun.
It is dangerous to view the Sun directly.
Instead, you should project its image onto a cardboard screen using binoculars or a telescope, or install special filters onto a telescope before looking through it.
Solar spots, which are dark regions on the Sun’s surface, are easily seen when viewing the Sun using these methods.
Bring a notebook and pencil to take notes.
A flashlight with a red filter will help you see your way in the dark without blinding your friends or yourself.
Now that you are all set up, familiarize yourself with the constellations using only your eyes: constellations help guide us to the celestial objects we wish to observe.
Once you have learned to orient yourself, binoculars will be very helpful – even professional astronomers commonly use them.
Mounted on a tripod, binoculars provide magnificent celestial vistas, revealing the topography of the Moon, the moons of Jupiter, a good number of nebulas, and even some galaxies.
At some point, you will want to add a refracting or reflecting telescope to push your observations to the next level.
The most important feature of a telescope is its optical precision of its optical components.
Look for well-known brands that have established and reliable reputations.
Newtonian-type telescopes are generally more affordable due to their simple design.
At the other end of the spectrum are amateur telescopes that are as powerful as those used by professionals thanks to computers and CCD cameras.
In some cases, the telescope can be left outside while you make your observations from inside, comfortably seated in front of your computer.
Luckily for those who do not own a telescope, there are many astronomy clubs with members who share a passion for space and are more than happy to let others look through their telescopes.
Do not hesitate to contact an astronomy club: the people are invariably a very welcoming bunch.
How does a star finder work?
An indispensable sky map A star finder (also known as a planisphere) is a circular map with an overlay that turns to show – through an opening in the overlay – the region of the sky that is visible for a specified time, date and location.
It is an incredibly useful tool for orienting yourself in the night sky, for identifying constellations, and for planning your stargazing night.
For southern Canada, a star finder designed for 45E north is sufficient.
The way a star finder works is simple.
The days and months of the year are shown around the edge of a circular base, and the hours of the day are displayed around the overlay.
By turning the overlay to line up the time of your observations with the date, the portion o the sky that is visible will appear through the opening in the overlay.
All that remains is to hold the star finder over your head and orient it with respect to North.
Instructions The activity simulates a real star search.
Simply click the hour you want and then drag the mouse over the circle in the middle and indicate the date and precise hour that you intend to search the sky overhead.
A precise representation of the sky at that precise moment may be viewed onscreen.
Use the star searcher to pinpoint stars, constellations and planets precisely.
Then wait for a starry night to use your star searcher to locate the constellations and stars that fill our sky.
The ASTROLab thanks the National Research Council of Canada for permission to use their electronic planisphere and to allow us to develop an interactive version of it.

Verbatim Image 1 (At school) Narration  This summer, I had the most amazing vacation camping with my family.
I know what you’re thinking:
"Sound  s boring!"
But let me tell you more about it… Sound  School area Image 2 (In the car) Narration   We left the city and were driving to some unknown destination.
In fact, I was beginning to think we were lost.
Bubble Are we almost there?
Bubble I’m hungry.
Sound  Car Image 3 Mother  Stop pestering your Father  !
We’re almost there… aren’t we?
Girl  Why are we going to spend our vacation in the woods near a river?
There’s nothing to do!
Boy  Yeah!
No stores, no video games… Nothing to see for miles around.
Sound  Car Image 4 Narration  My parents had decided to bring us fishing even though they knew my brother and I didn’t want to spend our vacation in the country.
They told us that the decision had been during a family meeting.
Bubble Meeting?
Sound  Car Image 5 (In the forest) Narration  When we arrived at our destination, we were not on a river.
Instead, we parked in a clearing in the mountains.
I was sure we were lost.
Girl  But there’s nothing here.
No friends… No music… Mother  You mean noise… Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 6 Boy  Dad, are you sure you wouldn’t rather be in a hotel in the city?
Father  I guarantee that what I am about to show you cannot be found in the city!
On the other hand, I could think of a really long list of things that can be found in the city but not in the forest!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 7 Narration  When nighttime came, my Father  showed us something really amazing.
Father  Look!
Boy  Oops!
Bubble Wow!
Narration  There were thousands of stars in the sky.
It was fantastic!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 9 Boy  I never realized there were so many.
It’s hard to believe!
Girl  Do you know what that white band across the sky is?
Father  That’s the Milky Way.
Our galaxy.
Narration  It was incredible!
There were so many more stars out there compared to in the city.
I’d never seen anything so beautiful.
Narration  My dad was right.
It was our galaxy.
He explained that the Milky Way contains at least 100 billion stars!
And beyond it, there are billions of other galaxies, each of which contains billions more stars!
I’m telling you, it made me dizzy just thinking about it… Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 11 Boy  I don’t understand why there are more stars here than in the city.
Girl  It’s the same sky after all!
Mother  The reason is light pollution.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 12 Girl  What’s light pollution?
Boy  It’s light that blinds us.
Mother  Your brother is right.
Light pollution is the artificial light we shine towards the sky that hides the stars.
It’s caused by light aimed in the wrong direction, or too much light, or lights that don’t even need to be on.
And it doesn’t just make stars disappear… it creates a bunch of other problems too.
Narration  My dad told us that in cities like Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, more than 95% of the stars have disappeared from the sky.
That’s a lot!
There’s almost none left!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 13 Boy  You’re exaggerating… Girl  Yeah… light isn’t like greenhouse gases.
We can turn off lights.
Light isn’t permanent.
Narration  But my parents weren’t exaggerating.
And it’s not just disappearing stars that are the problem.
Light pollution also has negative effects on animals, plants and even our health.
Not to mention that it’s a big waste of money and energy.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 14 Mother  Even though the effects of light pollution aren’t as serious as climate change, they’re still significant.
Mother  The starry sky has inspired humanity for thousands of years, yet today it’s disappearing.
Narration  When my Mother  <br /> said that, it made me sad.
I realized that most kids in our country have never even seen the Milky Way.
Sound  Countryside, animals, fire, strange noise Image 15 Narration  Suddenly, a strange thing happened!
A man came out of nowhere and joined in our conversation about light pollution.
Amerindian  Your parents are right.
Girl  Who are you?
Mother  Where did you come from?
Amerindian  I’m from around here and my name is Magella.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 16 Narration  Magella explained to us that the stars are our link to the Universe.
Without them, mankind is like a family living in a house without windows.
The starry sky is our window onto the cosmos… it’s our view into that fantastic place that gave birth to the Earth.
Light pollution closes that window.
Amerindian  Light pollution upsets many types of animals.
For example, some birds fly into buildings because the lights disorient them.
Even people are affected.
There are some important chemical substances inside us that our bodies can only make when it gets dark.
Life on Earth needs the night.
Amerindian  Would you like a marshmallow?
Sound  School area Image 18 (In the forest) Narration  I asked Magella what we can do to help.
His answer was a bit surprising… Amerindian  Discussing it is enough for now.
You will figure out on your own how you can help.
Girl  Stop talking nonsense!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 22 Narration  It was amateur astronomers coming to watch the sky. astronomer Good evening everyone!
Beautiful place, isn’t it?
He might have a telescope and computer, but without his gizmos he wouldn’t even know how to find Cassiopeia.
Narration  The man talking to us was the Technician  of the Mont Mégantic Observatory.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 24 Boy  But his stuff is so cool!
Technician  It sure is.
A telescope is a very powerful piece of equipment!
Don’t forget, though… you can still admire the stars without one.
Girl  True!
Technician  Yup!
All you need are your eyes in a place like this where the sky is really black.
There’s no point in using fancy equipment if you’ve lost our sense of wonder!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 25 Boy  Sure, but you have to admit, this telescope is really cool!
Technician  You’re absolutely right.
Telescopes have changed our view of the world.
Looking through a telescope is like magic.
It shows us the Universe!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 26 Technician  Look up at the sky.
Using only your eyes, you can see stars planets constellations Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 27 Technician  And you can use a star finder to help you find the main stars and constellations in the sky.
Girl  Neat!
Father  Did you come here because this is one of the best places for stargazing?
Technician  Absolutely!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 29 Girl  And there’s nothing we can do about it!
Technician  Come with me… I want to show you something.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 30 Narration  The Technician  walked us through the woods for a few minutes.
Boy  Where are we going?
Mother  I didn’t realize we were so close to the observatory.
Boy and Girl  Wow!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 31 (At the observatory of the Mont-Mégantic) Technician  I want to tell you about the program we put into place to curb light pollution.
Father  Certainly. But everyone must make an effort.
This is my best vacation ever!
Technician  Play the interactive game to reduce light pollution.
Technician  Now you can see through the telescope.
Narration  Imagine!
I got to look through one of the biggest telescopes in Canada.
There’s just one word I can think of to describe it:
WOW!
The astronomer knows what he wants to see, and the Technician  knows how to see it using the telescope.
Girl  Hey, it’s pretty cold here!
Father  The nights are chilly in the mountains, even in summertime.
Technician  And the telescope room is never heated.
Even in the winter!
If we heated it, the heat would leave through the dome and blur our vision of the stars.
But the control room is warm!
That’s where we keep our screens, computers and some hot chocolate to keep us awake!
Boy  Wow!
That’s Saturn!
Narration  These days, astronomers don’t look through telescopes with their eyes… instead they use instruments.
Luckily for us, they had just installed an ocular the night we were there because they were getting ready for the public astronomy festival taking place the following day.
Father  It’s hard to imagine, isn’t it?
Technician  In fact, stars are so far away that the light they emit takes several hundred years to reach us!
Their light carries a picture of how the stars looked several hundred years ago… It’s basically an image of the past!
They date back to when the Universe was very young.
That’s why we say that telescopes are like time travel machines!
Girl  Is it true that astronomers are a bit like explorers of the history of the Universe?
Technician  Yes, that’s true.
By exploring the stars, we have discovered that our existence here on Earth is part of 15 billion years of cosmic evolution.
The history of the Universe is our history too… Mother  Fascinating!
Technician  I don’t know if we are alone or not, or why we are here, but one thing is for certain: it’s all infinitely spectacular and mysterious… Never knowing the answer doesn’t really matter.
The most important thing is not to lose our sense of wonder.
Image 36 (In the forest) Boy  I can hardly wait for nighttime so we can start stargazing again!
Mother  But we’re leaving today.
Boy and Girl  Oh no!
We want to stay for the astronomy festival!
Sound  Countryside and fire Image 37 Father  Okay!
Boy and Girl  Yay!
Sound  Countryside and fire Image 38 Girl  Yay!
Thanks, Dad!
Boy  Thanks, Mom!
Boy  I bet I can find Cassiopeia before you!
Girl  You’re on!
And now I’m starting up a project to help us see stars from where we live.
Other Girls  Cool!
I’ll sign it!
All the Girls  Me too!
Boy  In the end, I won.
I found Cassiopeia before my sister!

Canada and Astronomy During the era when the New World was discovered and Canada was taking form, mankind believed that the earth was the centre of the universe.
About the same time that Québec was founded, a revolutionary event was taking place in Europe that would shake the very foundations of man’s view of the world: the invention of the telescope.
Ancient theories were shattered, the earth was but an insignificant heavenly body in the cosmos and humanity had lost its traditional points of reference.
The telescope marked the end of the geocentric universe and the passage toward a Universe of unconceivable dimensions.
Since then, astronomers have continued to perfect this fabulous instrument and explore awe-inspiring cosmic landscapes.
Thanks to telescopes, we have discovered a new world.
Canada was in the throes of nationhood at the same time as new astronomy was emerging and participated in its development and discoveries.
Did you know that at one time, two of the four largest telescopes in the world were in Canada?
Were you aware that our first observatories served to determine time with precision?
Did you know that today Canada is involved in some highly sophisticated projects, and that Canadian astronomers are renowned for being the most efficient in the world?
Indeed, few Canadians are aware that between 1994 and 2004, work carried out by Canadian astronomers resulted in the best "citation rate" in the world.
And what does this mean?
It means that on average, each paper published by a Canadian astronomer has been quoted 16 times by other astronomers around the world , and that this average is the best recorded for all countries.
The citation rate by peers represents a means of measuring the usefulness and quality of research carried out.
Based on the "Canada under the Stars" virtual exhibit highlights aspects of the legacy left to us by the impassioned stargazers of our country.
It is thanks to this legacy that modern Canadian astronomers have garnered a world-class reputation in the field of astronomy.

• Two class periods of approximately 45 minutes each are recommended to complete the exercise.
Parts 1 and 2 could be completed in the first session, Part 3 in the second session.
Part 3 requires student access to the Internet.
Part 4 is not accounted for in this timeline.
Materials Required Access to the Internet (Part 1 – teachers only, Part 3 – student access required) Land Cover Poster-map – Canada’s Land Cover (Part 2)
Main Objective Students will use the online Atlas of Canada and promotional poster-map to successfully interpret maps that use satellite imagery and other thematic information.
They will identify the dominant types of land cover in Canada and will compare two different classifications using information from the interactive Terrestrial Ecozone Map.
Lesson Sequence Part 1:
Teacher and Student Resources This section highlights the learning resources available to teachers from the Atlas of Canada Web site to find and prepare an introductory session for students about the Land Cover Poster-map and the data used to produce it.
A sample note and worksheet is included.
Part 2:
Canada’s Land Cover Using the Atlas of Canada Poster-Map Using the Land Cover Poster-map, students work in groups to identify the types of land cover for specific locations across the country.
First, they will use a standard atlas to identify the province/territory for each location on the map.
They will record this information in an organizer.
Land Cover and Terrestrial Ecozones Maps Using the Online Atlas of Canada Students will use interactive maps in the online Atlas of Canada to verify the land cover classification for each location in their organizer.
They will also use the Terrestrial Ecozones Map to identify the ecozone, physiography, climate and soil for each location.
This information will be added to their organizer.
Finally, students will choose two different types of land cover from their organizer and explain the differences using information collected throughout the exercise.
Extension & Evaluation Ideas Included in this section are discussion questions to conclude the exercise and ideas for evaluating student work.
Teacher and Student Resources Introduction The Atlas of Canada Web site has many learning resources available to teachers and students.
For this lesson, we recommend using some of the background information available online as an introduction to students before they begin working with the poster-map or online maps.
Information Available to Introduce the Land Cover Poster-map From the Land Section Above
Access detailed information about the Land Cover Map (Select Read about this map beside the map title to find this information.
This information can also be accessed by clicking the same links on and around the map.)
Canada’s Land Cover Using the Atlas of Canada Poster-Map Introduction Using the Land Cover Poster-map, students work in groups to identify the types of land cover for specific locations across the country.
They will record this information in a Land cover Organizer.
• The Land Cover Poster-map Teacher Note and Overhead – Introduction to Land Cover Student Worksheet – Introduction to Land Cover Copies of the organizers:
Steps
The teacher could also distribute a handout for students to review or pre-read before the exercise begins.
If computer access is readily available, you may want students to use the Web site to find this information themselves.
Introduce students to the concept of land cover using resources from Part 1.
Divide the class into groups.
Each group will be responsible for identifying the province or territory and type of land cover for specific places across Canada.
For the purposes of this lesson, we have divided the places on the map into 4 groups, with 8 places in each group.
Students use the Land Cover Poster-map to begin completing the organizer (see sample organizers below).
They will use the poster map and a paper atlas to complete the first two columns of information.
• Students use the interactive Land Cover Map in the Atlas of Canada Web site to verify the types of land cover and note the characteristics for each location in their organizer.
They will also use the interactive Terrestrial Ecozones Map to identify the ecozone, physiography, climate and soil for each location.
Materials
•
Choose Land from the pop-out menu that appears.
Choose Land Cover Map under the title Land Maps.
Use the Zoom In tool to find each location listed in your organizer.
Remember, this map has 31 different types of land cover.
•
Steps for Using the Interactive Terrestrial Ecozones Map Select Environment in the left hand menu under the title Explore Our Maps.
Choose Ecology from the pop-out menu that appears.
Choose Ecological Framework under the List of Topics.
Select the Terrestrial Ecozones Map under the title Ecological Framework.
Identify and record the ecozone for each place in your organizer.
Now you need to find information about the physiography, climate and soil for each location based on the ecozone.
To do this:
• Select the Get Info from Map tool above the map, and then choose the ecozone in which each place is located.
(For example, Vancouver is located in the Pacific Maritime ecozone.
Choose Get Info from Map, then select the Pacific Maritime ecozone on the map.)
A table of information will open.
Record the information about physiography, climate and soil for this ecozone.
Discussion Questions
• What other factors influence the types of land cover found within different regions of Canada?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an online atlas versus a paper atlas?
Essay Question Why is Canada’s land cover important to monitor and map?
Project Extension Students choose one type of land cover and investigate the physical and human factors that affect this classification.
They will present their findings in a poster presentation.
How do we use the land?
Landscape diversity is a product of the land’s many aspects.
An agrologist will look at the same area and interpret its features in terms of the processes that formed a given type of soil (such as chernozem or podsol).
A tourist will notice the area’s overall relief.
A politician will view the particular land as a nation or an administrative region.
Demographers and sociologists will study it as the backdrop of life, of populated places, or a setting for rural activities.
It is where we move, live and build.
Classifying Types of Land Cover Using Satellite Imagery
• There are 9 different types of land cover shown on the Atlas of Canada Poster-map.
The online map uses 31 classifications and is much more specific.
Each type of land cover can be identified by its unique spectral signature.
A spectral signature refers to the distinct appearance of each land cover class as seen by the satellite.
This means that each type of land cover reflects a specific wavelength of light and this unique signature is identified by a specific colour on the map.
A general colour guide to identify land cover classes is shown below.
Colour Guide:
• Medium brownish colours portray transition treed shrubland.
Yellow/orange to reddish colours stand for broadleaf forests.
Pink and red colours represent mixed forests.
Light greenish yellow to beige represents cropland.
Bluish and grey colours in the north stand for tundra.
Purple in the south represents grassland.
White stands for snow and ice.
Bright green in the North and mid latitudes represents wetland and shrubland
Student Worksheet – Introduction to Land Cover Definition of Land _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________
Like a puzzle, a landscape is a mosaic of countless features that mean something different to everyone.

Population Density Plan – Lesson Description Lesson Overview In this lesson, students will describe and explain population density patterns in Canada.
First, students will complete a "Pop Quiz" to determine their current knowledge of population in Canada.
Second, students will use the Atlas of Canada’s new Population Density poster­map to find the correct answers to the questions asked in the "Pop Quiz’ and then use the poster­map to make generalizations about population density patterns in Canada.
Third, students will use the interactive population density map from the Atlas of Canada Web site to collect data and compare the density patterns of various Canadian cities.
In addition, students will examine the advantages and disadvantages of living in an area with a high population density to areas of low population density.
Fourth, extension and evaluation ideas are provided.
Grade Level This lesson fits very well with the geography and social studies curriculum for Grades 9 to 12 in many provinces and territories.
It could also be modified to suit students from Grades 7 to 8.
· Two class periods of approximately 45 minutes each are recommended to complete the exercise.
Part 1 and 2 could be completed in the first session, Part 3 in the second session.
Part 4, the extension and evaluation ideas are not accounted for in this timeline.
Materials Required Part 1
· Analysis Activity Sheet
· Access to the Internet
Main Objective Students will successfully extract geographic information from print and non­print sources to describe and explain population density patterns in Canada.
Introduction Students will be introduced to the concept of population density, prior to completing a "Pop Quiz" to assess their current knowledge of population patterns in Canada.
Canada's Population Density Poster­map Using the poster­map, students will search for the correct answers to the "Pop Quiz" from Part 1.
Second describe population density patterns based on information from the poster­map.
Extension and Evaluation Ideas This section includes a research assignment that builds on the themes of this lesson.
Introduction Introduction For this lesson, we recommend introducing the topic of population and population density to students before they begin working with the maps.
Once students are familiar with the concept of population and population density they can attempt the "Pop Quiz" to assess their current knowledge of population patterns in Canada.
Introductory Instructional Strategies To familiarize students with three primary means of describing population (total population, population density and population distribution):
· Brainstorm with students their understanding of the terms total population, population density and population distribution.
· Have the students record definitions for these terms in an organizer or in their notes.
· Ask students to clear their desks or close their books.
Tell them that they are about to take a "Pop Quiz" to see how much they already know about various characteristics of Canada’s population.
Decide if you want them to work individually or in pairs.
This could work well as a Think, Pair, Share activity.
Distribute the quiz and allow approximately 5 minutes for completion.
There are no marks allocated to the quiz.
Discuss with students their responses to the various questions of the quiz.
Avoid correcting or providing answers to the questions as students will find the answers to the quiz in Part 2 of the lesson.

Population Density Interactive Map Introduction Students use the interactive Population Density, 2001 Map from the Atlas of Canada Web site to understand the relationship between population and area.
They will find and compare the population densities of several Canadian cities and begin to explain why some areas are more densely populated than others.
Students will also examine the advantages and disadvantages of living in an area with a high population density and a low population density.
Teacher Instructions
· Distribute the Analysis Activity Sheet to students before they access the Internet for this section of the lesson.
Review the instructions with students so that expectations are clear.
Analysis Activity Sheet ­ Canada's Population Density In this section of the lesson you will use an interactive map from the Atlas of Canada Web site.
You will find various Canadian cities and collect data about their population, area and density.
By the end of this section you should be able to explain why cities that have similar populations can have drastically different densities.
You will also examine the advantages and disadvantages of living in an area with a high population density and a low population density.
Follow the steps below to complete this activity.
Part A:
· Go to the Atlas of Canada Web site at: atlas.gc.ca Select People and Society from the left hand column under the title Explore Our Maps.
Choose Population from the pop­out menu that appears.
Choose Population Density, 2001 Map under the title 2001 Population.
Choose Read about this map.
Read the text and answer the question below:
What is Canada's population density? _____________________________________________
Part B:
Finding the data In this section, you will compare cities of similar populations and find their population density.
· Select the Population Density, 2001 Map of Canada.
· Complete the organizer below for each city that is listed.
o Choose the Zoom In tool and then click on Toronto.
Keep zooming in until it shows the census subdivisions in the legend.
o The purple areas represent the highest population densities.
Use the Get Info from Map tool and then click on the City of Toronto.
Record the 2001 population and population density.
o Choose Toronto Statistics beside the title Statistics Canada’s Community Profile and record the land area from their Web site.
Toronto's population is double the size of Montreal's, yet Toronto's population density is smaller.
Why? ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ 2.
Explain why Victoria has a higher population density than Ottawa.
Compare the city of Vancouver to Edmonton based on population, density and area.
Compare Charlottetown to St. John's based on population, density and area.
Go back to Part A of this activity.
What is Canada's population density?
Extension and Evaluation Ideas
Use the other 2001 population maps from the Atlas of Canada Web site to research population distribution and change for a specific region of Canada.
Research questions:
Is the population growing or declining in your region?
Why?
(Students can investigate various factors which affect regional changes in population growth and decline, such as the economy, urbanization and natural resource depletion.)

The map is based on satellite data obtained from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the NOAA-14 satellite.
The spatial resolution is about 1 kilometre.
This means that one pixel on the map is equal to one square kilometre on the ground.
Each land cover type can be identified by its unique spectral signature.
Each signature is identified by a particular colour on the map.

The physical geography of Canada comprises two great parts: the Shield and the Borderlands.
The Shield consists of a core of old massive, Precambrian crystalline rocks.
It is divided into five sub-regions:
Kazan, Davis, Hudson, James and Laurentian regions.
Each of these regions has its own geological characteristics.
The Kazan Region consists of vast areas of massive rocks that form flat, broad, sloping uplands, plateaus and lowlands.
The general aspect of the Davis Regions landscape is that of a broad, old erosion surface almost without surficial deposits.
Viewed from an elevated location, the landscape presents an even horizon interrupted by rounded or flat-topped ranges of hills.
Along the eastern coast, the relief is generally high.
The Hudson Region forms the main central depression on the surface of the Shield.
One of its sub regions, the Hudson Bay Lowland, is a low, swampy, marshy plain with subdued glacial features and a belt of raised beaches that border Hudson Bay and James Bay.
James Region exhibits the characteristic features of the Shield that are apparent in major uplands and plateaus.
The Laurentian Region comprises uplands and highlands that rise abruptly above the St.Lawrence Lowlands along their northwestern border.
The Borderlands regions are formed by younger rocks and surround the Shield like two rings: an inner ring, and an outer ring.
The inner ring comprises a chain of lowlands, plains and plateaus of generally flat lying sedimentary rocks.
The outer ring consists of discontinuous areas of mountains and plateaus in which the younger rocks are deformed.
Each of these areas is divided into regions each of which comprises many smaller subdivisions that are distinctive based on their topography and geology.
The physiographic regions forming the Borderlands include the Innuitian Region, the Arctic Coastal Plain, the Arctic Lowlands, the Interior Plains, the Cordilleran Region, the St.Lawrence Lowlands and the Appalachian Region.
The Innuitian Region is characterized by two zones of mountains that are separated by extensive and discontinuous terrain of more subdued topography formed by plateaus, uplands and lowlands.
The Arctic Coastal Plain includes the coastal terrain along the shores of the Arctic Ocean from Meighen Island to Alaska.
It is divided into three sections each of which has distinctive physiographic characteristics.
The Interior Plains is characterized in the southern part by semi-arid prairies; the central part is tree-covered; and the northern part is covered by tundra.
The Cordillera is divided into three large longitudinal zones called the Eastern System, the Interior System and the Western System.
Each system is further divided into areas and subdivided into mountains, ranges, plateaus, hills, valleys, trenches, basins, and plains.
Each has its own geological and physiographical characteristics.
The Cordillera is also divided transversely into a number of segments by east-west belts of relatively low terrain.
The St. Lawrence Lowlands comprise three separate parts; the West St.Lawrence Lowland, the Central St.Lawrence Lowland and the East St. Lawrence Lowland.
These lowlands are plainlike areas.
The Appalachian extends from southern Quebec and Gaspésie to encompass New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland.
The physiography is dominated by a well-developed peneplain that is generally highest in the northwest and slopes gently southeastwardly to the ocean.

Canada, with 3.33 people per square kilometre, has one of the lowest population densities in the world.
In 2001, most of Canada's population of 30,007,094 lived within 200 kilometres of the United States.
In fact, the inhabitants of our three biggest cities  Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver  can drive to the border in less than two hours.
Thousands of kilometres to the north, our polar region  the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut  is relatively empty, embracing 41% of our land mass but only 0.3% of our population.

The satellite image of Canada is a composite of several individual satellite images from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on board various NOAA satellites.
The colours reflect differences in the density of vegetation cover: bright green for dense vegetation in the humid southern regions; yellow for semi-arid and for mountainous regions; brown for the north where vegetation cover is very sparse; and white for snow and ice.

Over southern Canada maximum snow depth usually occurs in January or February, while the time of maximum accumulation occurs much later in mountain areas and in the Arctic.
The main features of the map are the pronounced maximum in snow accumulation over the western Cordillera (British Columbia and Yukon), where snow depths can exceed several metres, with a secondary maximum over Quebec and Labrador.
These maxima are related to their proximity to oceans, which act as sources of moisture and winter storms, and to the orographic effect of L the mountains in the case of western Canada.
The two maxima are linked by a band of higher snow A L A accumulation that follows the boreal forest zone; this is a preferred K track for winter storms.
To the north of this zone is the relatively shallow snow cover of the Arctic (low snowfall with extensive wind packing).
To the south, the depth of snow is limited by the shorter accumulation season and the substantial sublimation of snow over the Canadian Prairies.

Daily observations of the depth of snow on the ground have been made at most Canadian synoptic stations since the 1950s and at most climate stations since 1980.
Unfortunately, the stations in the snow-depth network are mainly located in southern Canada and do not adequately sample mountainous regions or high latitudes.
Daily Snow Depth Station Network, 1997
Snow-depth data are used extensively in applications such as regional climate monitoring, evaluation of climate models, roof snow load calculations for the National Building Code, snow-clearing contracts, winter survival of crops, biological studies and calculation of forest-fire severity.

In 1949, Newfoundland enters Confederation as the tenth province with the boundaries as delimited in 1927.
Canadas long and diversified settlement history is reflected in the two distinct patterns of boundaries that differentiate between eastern and western Canada.
The eastern boundaries closely conform to natural features such as drainage basins, while the boundaries of western and northern Canada reflect the administrative organisation of these lands by, first, the Hudsons Bay Company and later the Government of Canada.

In 1905, Alberta and Saskatchewan are created as provinces with the boundaries they have today and the District of Keewatin is transferred back to the Northwest Territories.
In 1898, the District of Yukon is separated from the Northwest Territories to become Yukon Territory; its boundaries are changed to those of today in 1901.
The boundaries of Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec are extended northward in 1912 to their present boundaries.

There are six time zones in Canada.
The island of Newfoundland observes a sixth time: it decided to set its clock at the halfway point of its time zone, or 3 hours and 30 minutes behind Greenwich time instead of four hours (which would be Atlantic time).

The median total income of persons 15 years of age and over with income was $22 120 in 2000.
The median income is the amount which divides income size distribution into two halves, where the incomes of the first half are below the median, while those of the second half are above the median.
Total income is income accrued from earnings, government transfer payments and other income.
The map shows the median total income for the census divisions where the population density is greater and equal to 0.4 persons per square kilometre.

Export Requirements Shipping and Customs Services International Freight Forwarding in Canada June 2006 (Revised Report) (Original Report January 2000)
The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on primary and secondary sources of information.
Readers should take note that the Government of Canada does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in this report, nor does it necessarily endorse the organizations listed herein.
Readers should independently verify the accuracy and reliability of the information.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
Although every effort has been made to ensure that the information is correct, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada assumes no responsibility for its accuracy, reliability, or for any decisions arising from the information contained herein.
International Freight Forwarding in Canada Transporting products from the production site or from the exporter's dock to the final destination is a complex undertaking.
Using the services of an international freight forwarder has many advantages and is often recommended for agricultural exporters, particularly when penetrating new or difficult markets such as developing countries.
International freight forwarders act on behalf of exporters in arranging transportation services.
The freight forwarder facilitates the international movement of goods by providing a wide range of advisory, administrative and physical services to the exporter.
International freight forwarders are multi-modal transportation specialists and are well placed to select the transportation method best suited for the type of product and the final destination at the lowest cost.
Most freight forwarders handle land, ocean and air transportation but usually have separate departments.
The freight forwarding industry in Canada consists of roughly 280 companies which employ about 15,000 employees.
They have offices in more than 150 locations across the country, although offices are mainly found in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.
Most international freight forwarders in Canada are members of the Canadian International Freight Forwarders Association (CIFFA), a well respected professional association (see CIFFA’s website at www.ciffa.com). CIFFA is a member of the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA).
When selecting a freight forwarder, an exporter should verify that the company in question is a member of CIFFA.
Members are required to carry minimum liability insurance coverage and must adhere to standard trading practices and responsibilities for freight forwarders.
Functions of the International Freight Forwarder According to the CIFFA, the most elementary role of the international freight forwarder is to arrange for the movement of goods from point A to point B, in accordance with the client's instructions, in the most economical, timely and safe fashion.
The ten major functions a forwarder can perform are: 1.
Freight forwarders can recommend the best (economical/timely/safe) routing and book space with a carrier.
Thanks to more efficient routing an exporter's goods may be more competitive in new markets.
Packaging:
They advise on or arrange for appropriate packaging, marking and labelling; or containerization.
This includes directions on stowing and container use.
Customs Clearance:
Freight forwarders need a basic knowledge of how local and foreign customs clearance works, and what papers are required for it.
They give advice on foreign import regulations.
Transport Insurance:
Unless the exporters make their own insurance arrangements, the forwarders are usually asked to do so because of their knowledge of the available coverage and their limitations.
Warehousing and Distribution:
Freight forwarders arrange storage, either after customs clearance or while still "in bond", and give advice on facilities, rates and procedures.
They also arrange for the distribution of large lots, including re-labelling and re-shipping.
Rate and Contract Negotiations:
Forwarders command a large volume of freight and are thus in a position of strength to obtain the best possible rates.
Finding Alternatives:
Forwarders are flexible and can find alternative ways of moving the goods in the case of an emergency such as earthquakes, strikes, weather or riots.
Groupage/Consolidation:
Smaller shipments may be moved into a full carload/trailer load/container load, at great savings to the exporter.
A World-Wide Network:
With branches or correspondents in all major ports/cities they act as groupage or degroupage agents, attend to reforwarding and customs clearance and are available for advice and consultation.
Follow-Up:
Forwarders stay in touch with their customers and see to it that their shipments, once delivered to the carrier, do indeed move out and reach their destination.
Furthermore, freight forwarders can provide the exporter with an initial quotation on the following:
• Cost of freight
• Port charges
• Consular fees
• Cost of special documentation
• Cost of insurance
Advantages to Freight Forwarding Freight forwarders are able to offer transportation consolidation services that are often cheaper than those the exporter could arrange directly with the transportation company.
If the exporter has insufficient volumes to fill a rail car, ocean container or highway truck, the freight forwarder can consolidate the shipment with other small shipments into a larger, more economical load.
The final cost of a full load is less for everybody involved.
At the destination, the freight forwarder or agent will unload and deliver the "deconsolidated" shipment to its destination in the target country.
Similar savings may be attained when freight forwarders negotiate volume discounts for clients or by using the freight-all-kinds (FAK) rate system.
In this case one rate is charged although different commodities are combined in a shipment.
For small firms, it may be more efficient to use the services of an experienced international freight forwarder than to develop an in-house transportation management unit.
Selecting a Freight Forwarder When selecting a freight forwarder, the exporter may find recommendations from other exporting firms and trade specialists useful.
Likewise, trade associations may be helpful and facilitate the selection process.
If you are exporting for the first time it is wise to speak with several freight forwarders before deciding which one to use.
The company's references and relevant experience in the destination country should be considered.
The following criteria should also be considered: 1.
Is the freight forwarder a member of CIFFA? 2.
Is the freight forwarder a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA)?
Although IATA membership is not mandatory when dealing with international air cargo, freight forwarders registered with IATA must meet criteria regarding financial and credit standing, physical facilities, professional qualifications and ethical practice.
Does the freight forwarder have a good credit rating?
Check with carriers to see that the freight forwarder has a good payment record.
Review a copy of their annual report.
Does the freight forwarder have a record of customer satisfaction?
Ask for a list of satisfied customers and contact them.
Does the freight forwarder have knowledge of and experience with your product, desired shipment method, carriers and destination country? 6.
Does the freight forwarder have a network of overseas agents and an office near the shipping port and in the destination country? 7.
Is the freight forwarder large enough to handle your business?
Do they have sufficient staff to handle your shipment? 8.
Do they have warehousing facilities if needed? 9.
Does the freight forwarder carry "errors and omissions insurance"? 10.
Does the freight forwarder have favourable shipping rates and schedules?
What services are provided free of charge? 11.
Does the freight forwarder offer a complete package of services (freight forwarding, brokerage, packaging, etc.)? 12.
Does the freight forwarder have electronic communications and electronic data interchange (EDI) capability? 13.
Does the freight forwarder have time to answer your questions?
Contracts The following contract elements should be discussed by the exporter and freight forwarder prior to finalizing a contract: 1.
A list of the transportation phases that are the responsibility of the freight forwarder.
Contract dates.
The date on which the freight forwarder will take charge of the product.
The delivery date.
A precise description of the delivery address and the names of the contact persons.
All the required export documentation.
Details of what constitutes proof of delivery to the consignee at the agreed point of delivery or transfer of ownership.
Insurance claim file.
Contract conditions should be in accordance with INCOTERMS 2000.
When deciding to use the services of a freight forwarder, the exporter should provide the freight forwarder with a Shipper's Letter of Instructions in addition to all other pertinent documents.
This letter will ensure that the forwarder is made aware of any special handling requirements and other administrative needs.
Other Considerations At times a freight forwarder may be hired just to arrange for a product to be transported.
This service is provided for a fee that will include the services as well as the cost of transporting the goods.
The exporter will normally factor in these costs when arriving at the price charged to the foreign buyer.
Sometimes freight forwarders specialize in one of two main transportation modes such as sea or air or have experience with one particular country.
Some freight forwarders have extensive networks that will prove more effective that others.
Only a limited number of freight forwarders truly specialize in the transportation of goods to developing countries.
Sometimes the forwarder will act as a broker for the carrier and will be paid a commission.
When acting as the carrier in contracts with exporters, performing freight consolidation work, forwarders are called non-vessel-owning common carriers.

NOTES:
Sailings and destinations change frequently.
For up-to-date information contact agents and individual shipping line websites.
Many ocean carriers have formed alliances designed to increase sailing frequencies and realize economies of scale.
Typically members of an alliance "pool" their ships on a particular trading route and allocate part of each ship's capacity to alliance members.
In this way alliance members can offer higher sailing frequencies than would be possible using only their own ships.
Also, alliances are used to achieve cost efficiencies, especially in terminal operations.
As a result of these alliances and agreements, shipments arranged through one carrier may actually be moved by a ship operated by another.

ALGERIA Agri-Food Country Profile Statistical Overview July 2004 Forward This information piece is provided to update the statistical information of existing documents on Algeria.
Due to recent economic developments an update was deemed necessary.
The government is currently focusing its attention on economic modernization and international relations, with specific goals of reducing unemployment and diversifying a petroleum-based economy.
In 2001, the Algerian government launched an economic recovery platform that supported a drive towards economic growth and stability.
The US$7 billion dollar program focused on revitalizing agricultural production, stepping up public water, improving transport and infrastructure, improving living standards and promoting local development.
Additional reforms seek to integrate Algeria into the world economy, freeing the country from it’s dependence on the hydrocarbon industry, and enabling private enterprise to access the energy and mining opportunities within the country.
The path towards liberalization of the economy has already shown positive impacts.
In 2003 economic reforms, as well as reforms to investment regulations attracted US$2.3 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI), the second largest destination for FDI in the African continent.
Current Situation The Algerian economy has grown steadily in the last few years, with growth rates of 4% in 2002 and 7% in 2003.
This growth is a result of strong performance in the oil and gas industry and regular increases in hydrocarbon and agri-food production.
Despite drawing in a lot of revenue for the economy, the oil sector does not contribute positively to the unemployment problem.
This has resulted in Algeria placing great emphasis on decreasing large scale unemployment estimated at 29% in 2003.
This number may reach as high as 50% for the under 30's age group.
With 60-70% of the population under the age of 30, the government has recognized the need for decisive action to alter the countries employment numbers.
The government generally relies on the army to maintain stability, but with the recent re-election of the first non military President, Abdelaziz Bouteflika with 85% of the popular vote, stability is expected to be maintained via other methods over the next two year period.
This non military leadership, supported by a majority of the population indicates that militants are a politically depleted force.
However, this stand against Islamist insurgency has not completely hindered their efforts, as they have since launched daring attacks on security forces.
There will be little pressure from a financial angle for reform, since the Algerian government projects record hydrocarbon sales in 2004.
Past reforms were required due to strong levels of expenditure and weaker earnings from oil and gas output.
Real GDP growth is expected to remain high at 6.2% in 2004 due to oil and gas industry output, with GDP growth rate projections extending into 2005 at 7.5%.
Overall export earnings are predicted to reach US$32 billion in 2004, a direct result of record high oil prices.
This will send the account surplus up to US$13 billion or 18% of GDP.
The surplus is expected to lessen in 2005 as oil prices level off, but will still remain significant at nearly 14% of GDP.
Algeria has accumulated a cushion of deposits in the central bank substantial enough to cover budgetary and balance of payments financing needs for over two years following any kind of downturn in oil prices.
Consumer Market It is difficult to assess the potential for western consumer goods in Algeria, as the Algerian consumer market has not yet been exposed to Western style marketing techniques.
As the number of working women increases, the demand for ready-made processed products is also increasing.
Traditional cooking habits are not forgotten, but variations on diets and food preparation are slowly being adopted.
As a traditional society, Algerians require traditional methods of product exposure.
While consumers are more familiar with seeing imported products, the combination of low incomes and high consumer prices for these goods has made success difficult.
A positive for the import sector can be seen through the rise in private importers since the economic liberalization that took place in 1997.
Algeria:
Key Algerian exports are dates, wine and potatoes.
Agricultural success is dependent on rainfall and therefore the sector can often suffer in times of drought.
The agriculture sector is growing in importance and size in Algeria.
The Algerian government is seeking to advance the sector through improved agricultural production techniques, a move designed to lessen their dependence on imports.
Mutton and lamb dominate Algerian consumption, closely followed by beef.
Veal, horse and rabbit are also eaten, but in small quantities.
Pork is not marketed in Algeria as it is prohibited by Islam.
Algerian’s are also extensive milk consumers, their needs are estimated at 3 billion liters a year, two thirds of which is imported.
Population Main Cities Algiers Oran Constantine Annaba 1.7 million 800,000 600,000 450,000
While this market is difficult , opportunities exist within the local food processing industry to provide raw and semi- processed goods.
The number of food processors is growing, and they are demanding quality raw materials.
Key processing sectors are dairy and milling.
Many processors prefer to import directly as opposed to buying from a local importer.
Canadian exporters can play a role in directly supplying these processors.
Similarly, the tourist niche also exists.
Canadian exporters of consumer-oriented products
Algeria:
Country Profile Statistical Overview
This ongoing process will call for technical assistance and farm equipment not available in Algeria - these are prospects that would benefit from Canadian involvement and expertise.
Within agriculture, the cereals sector is greatly affected by problems with efficiency and outdated technology.
Durum wheat takes up 43% of the country’s agricultural production area, followed by soft wheat at 19%.
However, government programs have already begun to influence its performance.
Harvests of durum wheat, wheat, barley and oats all increased.
Despite the great seasonal results, cereal imports were required to supplement approximately one third of national cereal requirements.
Trade Algeria reported a trade surplus of US$10.8 billion in 2003.
Exports totaled US$23.8 billion, up over 26% from 2002, while imports increased by over 8%, to US$13 billion.
Hydrocarbons continued to lead exports, at US$23 billion, an increase of 28% over 2002 totals.
Petroleum, natural gas and petroleum products dominate Algeria’s exports at 97% of the whole market.
Trade Agreements Algeria has established a number of trade agreements which are growing in strength.
Most important of these is the Arab Maghreb Union.
Nations party to this agreement include Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya and Mauritania.
Bilateral investment agreements are in place between Algeria and France, Italy, Belgium and Spain.
Algeria has maintained lasting ties with France.
Market Access Recent government initiatives in all areas of business are attempting to facilitate easy access to the Algerian market.
The move is part of an effort to bring foreign trade regulations into conformity with WTO standards.
With these standards comes the requirement of import licensing, a licensing regime was intended to be
Canadian market access efforts in 2003 resulted in the Canadian Food Inspection Agency negotiating a certificate for the export of dairy products and bovine semen.
This year Canada hopes to negotiate a certificate for live cattle.
Algerian organizations tend to deal only with foreign partners who have managed to gain their confidence through personal visits, careful follow up, and the ability to honor commitments.
It is often necessary to have previous international experience and to spend large amounts on market development, but the contracts are substantial in terms of length.
Algeria provides great incentive to invest within the country.
Companies established in Algeria that export 100% of production are exempt from taxes and companies exporting 50% of production are exempt from 50% of taxes.
Offerings of reduced customs duties, reduction in social security contributions for Algerian employers from 24.5% to 7%, a three-year exemption from the value added tax on goods and services acquired locally or imported, and exemption on property taxes are all in place to attract FDI.
This attraction has been successful with Algeria second only to South Africa in FDI generation on the African continent.
Canada - Algeria Trade and Investment Algerians take a favourable view of Canada’s international policies, including those toward the developing world.
There is a mutual desire between the two governments to intensify
Canada also provides financial assistance through open lines of credit.
The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) provides financial assistance and counseling to Canadian firms seeking to initiate business activity in Algeria.
Algeria holds the second position in Africa and the Middle East for level of contributions under the program, a strong indication of bilateral interest and support.
Country Profile Statistical Overview
Two-way agricultural trade was valued at $244 million in 2003.
Canada’s exports were valued at $242.3 million, and imports from Algeria were valued at $1.7 million resulting in a positive trade balance of $240.6 million.
Lentils represented 12.6% of the export market, while chickpeas, milk powder and sunflower seeds each represented less than 1% of the total agricultural export market.
Canada imported $955,000 worth of dates from Algeria, $632,000 worth of grape wines and $37,000 worth of both tobacco and olive oil.
Bulk exports decreased from 2002 to 2003, a result of the decrease in wheat exports.
Bulk total exports in 2002 were valued at $323 million, which decreased to $206 million in 2003.
Intermediate goods remained close to 2002 totals, amounting to $35.7 million in 2003.
Exports of consumer goods dropped dramatically from $2.3 million in 2002 down to only $63,685 in 2003.

Israel COUNTRY PROFILE
Economy The Israeli Economy is open and modern, featuring a well developed high tech sector.
With considerable help from foreign aid, government assistance and massive immigration, Israel has developed its economy considerably in the past 25 years.
Over this time, Israel’s economic perspective has shifted towards greater market orientation and an openness to the world economy.
Budget cuts, privatization, investment in infrastructure as well as tax cuts make up an economic reform strategy that has lead to economic growth of 1.2% in 2003.
These fluctuations follow a worldwide economic downturn and slow recovery.
Deterioration in security conditions coupled with an economic slump effected all sectors, especially Israel’s fast growing high tech sector.
Key sectors in the Israeli economy are information and communication technology, environment,
agriculture, biotechnology and transportation.
It is estimated that nearly 33% of the workforce is employed in the services sector, delivering public, community and personal services.
This growth occurred while combating the challenges of: national security, the absorption of immigrants, establishing modern infrastructure and providing quality public services.
However, In 2003 Israel reported a trade deficit of US$6 billion, their lowest deficit since 1991.
In response to this negative balance, the government has established economic reforms, foreign investment incentives such as grants and tax exemptions, as well as free trade agreements with many countries, including Canada.
These reforms seek to address the trade balance, as well as, challenges such as inflation and unemployment.
Unemployment increased to 10.7% in 2003 due to high immigration rates as well as a rise in female participation in the labor force.
During economic downturns families required an additional wage earner - the "added worker" economic phenomenon ensued.
However the 2003 economy displayed promise through a rise in the number of

Most foods on store shelves have a kosher label and those that don’t cater to a very small segment of the population.
The kosher consumer does not shop in stores that sell non-kosher products.
The large consumer chains and many smaller stores therefore do not carry these goods.
The large food processing plants also do not use non-kosher raw material in order to not jeopardize this market segment.
The institutional food market only carries Kosher foods.
By complying with Kosher requirements, exporters maximize market presence and consumer exposure.
Israel has a total land area of 20,770 sq km.
Israel proclaimed its capital Jerusalem, but Tel Aviv is considered the major population, financial, commercial and industrial centre.
The landscape is generally hilly and arid.
The climate is predominantly hot and dry with desert areas in the east and temperate conditions in the west.
There is a significant difference in climate from the winter to the summer.
The overall climate requires a significant amount of land to be irrigated in order to produce agricultural products.
Natural resources include timber, potash, copper ore, natural gas, phosphate rock, magnesium bromide, clays and sand.
Jerusalem is home to the Knesset (legislative body).
However, consumers do purchase specific items in different venues.
Prospective exporters hoping to enter the Israeli market often look to the help of intermediaries experienced in particular markets.
Knowledgeable connected representation is the key to the Israeli marketplace.
Establishing distribution channels with the assistance of reputable representation also serves to minimize risk in a country with a current situation such as Israel.
Israel has a diverse import system with small two to three person operations that contract out distribution, to large companies that offer full marketing and logistical services.
Most importers prefer exclusivity, particularly for new products.
However, large international firms often use multiple importers for distribution.
An exporter to Israel can decide on an agent or distributor depending on the amount of control they wish to have over distribution.
It is also important to keep in mind the strict marking and labeling requirements in Israel (see below).
Also, when traveling to Israel for business pay attention to security.
Travel reports are offered by Foreign Affairs Canada at http://www.voyage.gc.ca . Documentation Standard documentation includes a certificate of origin, a commercial invoice, a bill of lading as well as a kosher certificate.
______________________________________________________________________________ Country Profile:
It is critical that products that are not kosher do not use wording or symbols that could imply that the food is kosher.
For more information consult the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Web site at http://www.inspection.gc.ca - consult section 4.16.
Due to the specific nature of labelling requirements, Canadian exporters are urged to consult with and Israeli authority to ensure all requirements are met.
Trade Agreements The Canada Israel Free Trade agreement (CIFTA) which came into effect on January 1, 1997, improves market access for agri-food products of export interest for both Canada and Israel.
For more information on the Free Trade Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the State of Israel please consult http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca Israel has developed numerous strong relationships in order to strengthen its position in international markets.
The most crucial agreements being the Free Trade Agreements with the European Union, the United States and the European Free Trade Association.
These agreements place Israel in a free trade partnering position with primary economic regions worldwide.
Such incentives include special grants, as well as tax exemptions determined by geographic location of the investment.
Documents that need to be authenticated must first be notarized in Canada.
The exporter endures no cost by sending the documents to International Trade Canada’s Authentication and Service of Documents branch.
Labelling Requirements Israel demands strict marking and labelling procedures.
The following information should be included on all consumer packaging entering Israel:
• country of origin; name and address of the producer; name and address of the Israeli importer; contents; weight or volume in metric units.
Hebrew must be used.
The Israeli Chambers of Commerce project an increase in foreign investment in 2004 as the US economy is on a slow path to recovery.
Market Access In recent years Israel has placed emphasis on opening up to the world economy through free trade agreements with many countries including Canada.
These measures seek to reduce market barriers and tariffs.
The Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) implemented in 1997 has helped to double trade since its inception.
CIFTA presently grants duty-free access to Canadian exports of wheat, frozen berries, potato flakes, flour, corn, frozen vegetables and various dried peas and beans.
The Canadian Government has set market access priorities for 2004 to expand CIFTA to include other agricultural products, and secure longer-term opportunities for Canadian agri-food products in areas such as vitamins, potatoes and pet food.
Tariffs The CIFTA improves market access for agri-food products.
Certain CIFTA guidelines for specific agri-food products are as follows:
• annual duty-free tariff rate quotas of 200,000 tonnes of course grains, 9,000 tonnes of malt, 10,000 tonnes of pulse crops.
Value Added Tax Excluding fresh fruit and vegetables, all imported products are subject to a value added tax (VAT) of 18%.
Ministry of Health for drugs, Ministry of Transport for vehicles) Kosher Certificate - required in order for importers to market kosher food products.
Exporters who wish to maximize their market presence should comply with Chief Rabbinate requirements.
Please consult Canadian contacts at the end of this report for Kashrut authorities in Canada.
This agency is also responsible for labelling and packaging requirements.
Plant material must be approved by the Plant Protection and Inspection Agency.
Imported meat must be licensed by the Israel Veterinary Services (IVS) and originate in a processing plant approved by the IVS.
Imported fish require a Certificate of Origin and Hygiene.
Market Constraints Under the rules of the CIFTA, both Canada and Israel have agreed to let their rights and obligations in trade be governed by the agreements under the World Trade Organization.
Agricultural trade between Israel and Canada face a number of barriers in the form of quotas agreed upon in the CIFTA.
Two way agricultural trade was valued at $34 million in 2003.
Canada’s exports were valued at $12 million in 2003 and imports from Israel were valued at $22 million, resulting in a negative agricultural trade balance of $10 million.
Rape or colza seeds for sowing accounted for $2.3 million or 19% of Canada’s agricultural exports to Israel in 2003.
Canada’s other principal exports were lentils (dried, shelled, weathered, skinned or split) $1.4 million.
• confectionary products-chocolates, gum candies, biscuits.
• bakery products-baked snacks and consumer ready dried food items.
Canadian private labels have enjoyed great success in the Israeli market over the past few years.
Canadian private label pet food accounts for 8% of the private label pet food sales in Israel.

Iran Agri-Food Country Profile Statistical Overview August 2004 Forward This information piece is provided to update the statistical information of existing documents on Iran.
Due to recent economic developments an update was deemed necessary.
Economy Iran’s economic structure is comprised of state owned large enterprises, small scale village agriculture and private trading and service business enterprises.
Iran’s large and fast growing population coupled with their hold on the world’s fourth largest oil reserve, make Iran a significant economy.
Oil sales account for over one third of the governments total income.
Natural resources and key sectors within Iran’s economy - as well as areas for opportunity are oil (roughly 10% of world’s oil), gas (15.5% of world’s gas), agriculture, mining and minerals, petrochemicals (output of 13 million ons per year one sixth of country’s non oil exports), information technology, environment and electric power.
Economic indicators reveal that economic growth cannot keep pace with labor force growth and advancing unemployment rates that are set at 16%, but unofficial estimates reach as high as 30%.
Economic growth is a high priority, but one that has proceeded at a reserved pace.
Current Situation Iran’s current situation is highly reflective of two decades of revolution, war and economic struggle.
With most economic activity controlled by an often inefficient state sector, changes in economic structure are solely dependent on the state taking considerable action.
The new five year plan is a step towards a more
On one hand Iran is comprised of a young and economically active population.
A demographic shift has resulted in nearly 50% of the population in the under 20 age category and 70% of the population is under 30.
Demographics Total Population Growth Rate Age Breakdown 0-14 yrs 15-64 yrs 65 yrs and over Life Expectancy Total Male Female 70 million 1.07% 28% 67% 5% 69.5 yrs 68 yrs 71 yrs
Forecast Iran’s current president will likely be unable to advance liberalizing policies before his final term is up in mid-2005, due to many powerful institutions being run by conservative minorities.
Recent parliamentary elections have lead to a conservative majority which will likely to lead to more reliability in government and a likeliness for coherent policy making.
The incoming parliament will stand behind their campaign, and work towards improved living standards.
GDP is anticipated to remain close to 2004 standards in 2005 at about 3.9%, while the average rate of inflation is forecasted to fall from a 2003 rate of 16%, to 15.5% in 2004 decreasing further to 14.7% in 2005.
This is a refreshing downward trend, but inflationary pressures are expected to remain.
Iran’s population is increasing urbanized, with 65% of the population living in larger cities.
Despite perceptions, only 20% of Iran’s total land mass is made up is desert, the remaining area is made up of natural range land, forest, and roughly 20% arable land.
The major constraint to further development of the agricultural sector is not the availability of land, rather the availability of water.
Only 10% of the country receives adequate rainfall for agriculture, irrigating techniques are heavily relied upon to battle limited water supply.
Much of the arable land is used to grow wheat and barley.
Man-made irrigation systems are used in certain areas, while rain-fed and dry farming methods are used in western and north-western Iran.
Iran has become more or less self-sufficient in the production of certain fruits, vegetables and livestock.
A demand for western products and services does exist, and is an increasing trend in the consumer market.
It is deficient marketing, market research, and unreliable distribution methods that are slowing an otherwise forward moving trend.
Brand recognition and advertising will continue to be a problem for imported products in Iran as a number of forms of advertising are banned in the country.
Also, the government is very firm on what products can and cannot be sold to their citizens therefore putting solid restrictions on import opportunities.
While efforts to modernize the retail sector in Iran have provided the country with more modern stores, the urban bazaar has historically been the heart of the Iranian town.
In most areas the bazaar is centrally located and covers a large area with small shops grouped by service or product.
An ideal environment for Iranian’s to practice their widely used bargaining skills.
Other opportunities for Canadian companies include trade in livestock genetics, including breeding stock, semen and embryos.
Also, there exists a demand for new healthful foods, nutraceuticals and halal meat.
There is also a demand for agricultural expertise and consulting management, for technology and equipment for food processing, packing, and quality control.
subsistence agriculture and achieve modernization.
These include dam building, subsidization of irrigation and more governmental transparency.
The key issue is how rapidly the country should open itself to the modernizing influences of the outside world.
The government's last 5 Year Development Plan helped liberalize production and marketing in the sector, allocated foreign exchange at a preferential rate for the import of agricultural machinery and continued to pay subsidies on domestic production.
This plan expires in 2005, but similar priorities are expected to extend into the future.
The Ministry of Agriculture has been urging peasants to consolidate their small, scattered farming plots and to form rural production cooperatives (RPC's).
Optimally, each RPC will cover 2,000 to 92,500 hectares of land and employ 200 to 250 farmers, who will maintain their individual ownership.
While the movement towards RPC's has been slow, it is estimated that by 2022 almost all of Iran's farms will consist of RPC's or large commercial farms.
Despite the importance placed on agriculture, problems plaguing the sector’s development remain, including shortages of water, inefficient irrigation, outdated farm machinery, lack of raw materials, and the common practice of subsistence farming.
The government heavily subsidizes delivered water for irrigation but suspects that high subsidization of the cost of water is a deterrent to its efficient use.
As a result, only about 50% of cultivated land is equipped with full or partial control irrigation.
By far, the largest proportion of irrigated land is for wheat.
Exports totaled US$30 billion while, imports were valued at US$26 billion.
Both exports and imports increased from 2002 and are likely to continue an upward trend for 2004 trade totals.
Oil and gas industry output accounted for 80% of Iran’s total exports in 2003, other top exportable commodities in Iran are chemical and petrochemical products, fruits and nuts, and carpets.
Leading suppliers to Iran are Germany at 11%, Italy at 9%, France at 8%, China at 7% and South Korea at 6.5%.
Trade Agreements Iran’s "Islamic foreign policy" emphasizes support for Muslims globally as well as increasing diplomatic contacts with developing countries.
Syria continues to be a significant trade ally to Iran.
Iran maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with Russia and other former Soviet states.
Both Iran and Russia agree that their national interest is best served if more development occurred in Central Asia.
Country Profile Statistical Overview 2004
This is as a result of deliberate government planning.
However the government does wish to establish outside relations in a continuous effort to modernize the country.
Many opportunities for trade exist in Iran, but interested companies must accept a higher level of risk than would be evident in other countries.
Import barriers in Iran enforce Islamic law, and prohibit numerous commodities including alcohol and pork.
Iran’s import rules and regulations are complex and ever-changing.
Each year the Iranian Ministry of Commerce publishes a new handbook on export and import guidelines.
All imports must be registered with the Ministry of Commerce, from which a general importing license is obtained.
Also, in the majority of cases, the importer must have the approval of the relevant ministry for their commodity.
In order for an Iranian company to be granted the opportunity to import, the product imported must be classified as one of strategic importance (e.g. wheat, edible oil or specific technology).
In the past Iranian government has banned or heavily restricted through high tariffs, the importation of agricultural products that are produced in Iran.
In cases where the country’s production cannot meet domestic demand, such products can be imported into the country with the proper Ministry of Commerce and Agricultural Jihad approval.
Despite recent improvements and ongoing efforts to improve Canadian access to the Iranian market, nearly 80% of the economy is state-owned, making the client - the government.
Procurement policies and complexities can lengthen the trade process considerably.
As privatization slowly proceeds and Canadian-Iranian efforts to facilitate business continue such barriers will likely dissipate.
For the time being, the Government Trading Corporation of Iran (GTC) is affiliated to the Ministry of Commerce and imports essential commodities such as wheat, sugar, rice, crude vegetable oil, fertilizers, frozen chicken and baby milk powder.
These commodities are delivered to the recipient organization(s) and they in turn distribute the commodities inside the country.
This is an internal trade agreement between the Iranian Government and the GTC.
relations are common with diplomatic relations commencing in 1955, ending from 1980-1988 and re-instated in 1988 to present date.
Exchanges will continue in efforts to solidify cultural, bilateral and commercial bonds.
Iranian business people are very keen to find Canadian suppliers for commodities, livestock feed, and certain types of technology and equipment.
Although there is limited potential for Canadian value-added agri-food products at present, it is not due to a lack of market demand, but more to import restrictions and local processing capabilities.
While many trade opportunities exist in other sectors, at present Canadian agriculture and agrifood exports are centered around bulk commodities.
This sector provides the most vast opportunity for Canadian exporters.
In all, it appears Iran’s weaknesses are Canadian strengths, creating a highly-beneficial trade opportunity for Canadian companies.
In 2003, Canadian exports to Iran amounted to $236.8 million, up nearly 40% from 2002, while Iran’s exports to Canada amounted to $63.2 million, up 15% from a year earlier.
Iran ranks 46th as an export market for Canadian goods and 75th as a source of imports into Canada.
Imports from Iran were dominated by carpet and rug mill output accounting for 28% of the total market or $17.8 million.
Non-citrus fruit and tree nut farming output represented 24% of Canadian imports from Iran.
Fruit and vegetable canning, pickling and drying represented 19% of the import market while aerospace products and parts represented 5%.
The 15% increase in Canadian imports from Iran was in most part due to the doubling of the non-citrus fruit and tree nut market.
Soybean exports represented 10% of Canadian exports to Iran, while material handling equipment accounted for 7% of exports, and mining and oil and gas - as well as navigational, measuring and medicinal equipment each accounted for 5% of the market.
The 40% increase in Canadian exports to Iran is partly explained through the $44 million dollar increase in the wheat export market as well as the $15 million dollar increase in material handling machinery exports.
Canada’s exports were valued at $108.6 million, and imports from Iran were valued at $31.3 million resulting in a positive trade balance of $77.3 million.
Wheat dominated exports accounting for 72.5% or $78.7 million of Canada’s agricultural exports to Iran.
This commodity has always been a top export to Iran but amounts can fluctuate form the $370 million exported in 2001 to the $34 million in 2002.
Wheat imports are closely guided by government, these imports are of strategic importance to the country to meet domestic needs, but government closely protects the commodities that are harvested at home, such as wheat.
Intermediate goods also increased from $1.5 million in 2002 to $4.5 million in 2003, while consumer goods exports remained low but fell from $432,000 in 2002 to $313,000 in 2003.

Egypt Past, Present & Future Report February 2007 Overview Egypt‘s population, the largest in the Arab world, has been rapidly growing in recent years, increasing from 64 million in 2000 to 75 million in 2005.
This large, particularly young consumer base holds a growing penchant for North American foods, and ultimately presents great opportunity for Canadian agri-food exporters.
Egypt enjoys a diverse economy backed by a rich supply of natural resources, highly integrated manufacturing capabilities, thriving agricultural sector, attractive tourism industry and skilled labour force.
The country is also home to an expanding middle-aged consumer group and dominant young population that are the driving forces behind the country’s demand for more North American-type packaged, processed and convenience foods, as well as fast food outlets.
Coupled with a rising standard of living and greater disposable incomes, this 15 million-strong consumer group may become an extremely lucrative target market for Canadian agri-food exporters in the future.
Canada-Egypt Relations Canada and Egypt have maintained a positive bilateral relationship since the countries first established diplomatic relations in 1945.
The countries currently share trade, development, educational and cultural partnerships.
Recently, Canada opened an embassy in Cairo symbolizing a closer relationship with Egypt.
Canada continues to be an important destination for many Egyptian immigrants, and as a result, extensive Egyptian-Canadian communities have developed in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.
• Top Canadian exports to Egypt Trade balance $172.3 million Canada-Egypt Ag Trade (2006) $149.2 million include coal (17%), newsprint Exports $140.6 million (16%), and iron ores and Imports $8.6 million concentrates (8%).
Canada-Egypt Bilateral Trade (2005)
•
Agricultural Trade Total agricultural trade between Canada and Egypt has fluctuated over the past several years, but overall increased by 350% from $42.3 million in 2000 to $149.2 million in 2006, largely due to an increase in Canadian exports.
Bulk and intermediate goods consistently represent the majority of Canadian agri-food exports to Egypt.
Such goods comprised almost all Canadian agri-food exports in 2006 at 97%.
Canada’s agricultural exports to Egypt increased by 390% between 2005 and 2006 mainly due to large increases in bulk wheat and durum wheat exports, as well as intermediate milk powder exports.
This rise was largely due to increases in chocolate imports between 2004 and 2005, and growth in olive and vegetable imports between 2005 and 2006.
Plants used in pharmaceutical production have remained Canada’s top imported commodity from Egypt over the past decade and typically account for about 16% of total agri-food imports from Egypt respectively.
Canada’s Top 5 Agricultural Exports to Egypt (2006) Wheat, nes Lentils, dried/shelled Milk powder Soya beans Linseed $102.6 million $15.5 million $5.8 million $4.6 million $2.2 million
Complete statistical summary available at: http://ats.agr.gc.ca/stats/egypt_e.pdf
• Total Canada-Egypt agricultural trade represents approximately 33% or $149.2 million of all trade between the two countries.
Top Canadian exports to Egypt in 2006 included wheat totalling $102.6 million and representing approximately 73% of total agri-food exports, dried and shelled lentils at $15.5 million or 11% of total exports, and milk powder worth over $5.8 million and 4% of exports.
2006 bulk exports to Egypt totalled $112 million, increasing by 1087% from $10.3 million in 2005, while intermediate exports totalled $25.1 million and showed about 7% growth from 2005.
Top Canadian imports from Egypt in 2006 included whey valued at over $1.5 million and making up about 43% of all agri-food imports, products consisting of natural milk valued at almost $580,000 or 16% of total imports, and food preparations totalling almost $300,000 or 8% of such goods.
Other major Canadian agri-food imports included ice cream and unsweetened milk and cream powder, worth over $260,000 and $210,000, or roughly 7% and 6% of total imports respectively.
Economy Major economic and political reforms have transformed Egypt into a more privatized economy over the past 30 years.
Historically, growth has been driven by public sector spending and exports, while domestic consumption and investment showed slower increases.
To accelerate growth, the Egyptian government recently introduced an economic liberalization program.
Reductions in personal and corporate income tax rates to 20%, and energy subsidies, as well as the privatization of several enterprises were implemented between 2005 and 2006.
Such reforms are expected to result in strong future economic growth that will raise the standard of living, and in turn, encourage consumption and investment.
However, Egypt’s fiscal deficit and inflation rate are being stretched as a result of such efforts.
The Egyptian government has identified foreign investment as a critical component to sustained economic growth.
As a result, investors are given special exemptions and incentives, such as the right to send home capital, own foreign currency accounts, and receive equal treatment.
However, several barriers to investment remain including a high level of bureaucracy, complex tax systems and customs procedures, the prohibition of foreigners owning agricultural land in certain regions, and the role of commercial agent and importer or trader being limited to Egyptian nationals.
To offset these obstacles, the Egyptian customs authority is currently addressing its procedures and aims to introduce a pre-clearance system and simplified inspection process, while the state plans to increase privatization and fiscal transparency, and improve tax regulations.
Gross Domestic Product (2006) GDP GDP growth GDP/ capita GDP/ capita (PPP) US$106.2 billion (2006) 6.8% (2007) 6.6% (2008) 5.8% US$ 1,347 US$ 4,175
Current Economic Trends
• GDP reached a value of US$106.2 billion in 2006 and is forecast to reach over US$113.2 billion in 2007.
• The Central Bank has implemented a more consistent monetary management system that has resulted in better control over the inflation rate, and helped to strengthen the Egyptian pound against the United States’ dollar.
Forecasted Economic Trends
• GDP growth is forecast to slow to 6.6% in 2007, and further decrease to 5.8% and 5.1% in 2008 and 2009 respectively.
• Egypt’s future economic expansion is forecast to result in steady employment growth, reducing the unemployment rate from its 2006 level of 10%.
Egypt Country Report:
Consumers at all income levels are willing to spend a large portion of their income on food, as eating is an integral part of Egyptian culture.
Typically, middle- and upper-income families spend 1.5 times more on food and beverages than lower income families.
Food and non-alcoholic beverage expenditure represents the largest consumer expenditure category in Egypt, making up roughly 40% of total expenditure in 2005.
Total consumer expenditure in Egypt was roughly $71 million in 2005; this value has increased by 25% since 2000.
Egyptians typically eat three meals a day, with lunch being the largest, most important meal.
Traditional Egyptian meals include vegetables and rice or pasta.
Meat is also included, depending on affordability.
However, in recent years there has been an increasing interest in North American and European food and beverage products.
Snack food consumption, in particular sweets, salty foods, and carbonated beverages, has shifted away from traditional Egyptian snack foods.
Egyptian consumers are not typically concerned with healthy eating; however, higher-income groups have generally higher levels of awareness about healthy eating, and may choose products with lower fat and cholesterol.
Expansion of fast food chains and hotels and resorts has increased potential for imported goods to enter Egypt’s foodservice market in recent years.
The fast food market is growing tremendously in Egypt, with about 30 North American chains currently located in the country.
A&W, Chili’s, KFC, McDonalds, Hard Rock Café, Little Caesars, Pizza Hut, and TGI Fridays are some examples of North American chains dominating Egypt’s fast food market.
Egypt’s successful and growing tourism industry is also becoming more accommodating of imported food products as tourists are more aware of international food trends.
This industry is seeing large expansion in areas such as Cairo, the Red Coast and Sinai.
There are currently about 170 hotels in Sharm El Sheikh (Red Sea Resort), and this number is expected to increase as the government continues to support investment in hotels and tourist resorts.
More affluent households and single people may eat out at least once a week.
• Egypt has a young population, with over 50% of Egyptians under the age of 25.
In 2005, the median age was 22.6.
Young adults in the older range (23-29), especially those from affluent backgrounds, represent a lucrative consumer market for exporters as this group spends much of their income on entertainment, travelling and dining at restaurants.
Between 1990 and 2015, this group will increase in size by more than 100%.
Middle-aged adults commonly have children and are consumed by increasingly busy lifestyles.
Population Density/Regions
• 90% of Egypt’s population inhabits 10% of the country’s landmass, and are mostly located along the Nile and the Nile Delta.
20% of the population lives in Cairo, with Alexandria and Mansoura following as the next largest cities in Egypt.
Retail Food Market
• There are a growing number of supermarket chains and hypermarkets in Egypt, which are driving consumer demand for new-to-market food and beverage products.
Egypt’s production of beverages (i.e. mineral and bottled water, soft drinks, tea, coffee and alcoholic drinks) are dependant on substantial fruit and vegetable supplies.
Popular and Growing Products
The consumption of bottled water increased by about 50% between 1998 and 2003; this is mostly due to the increasing awareness of poor tap water quality in Egypt.
Most consumers from middle- and upper-income segments are more drawn to using bottled water at home instead of tap water.
75% of soft drinks consumed by Egyptians are carbonated.
The consumption of carbonated beverages increased by more than 15% between 1998 and 2003.
This growth was mainly due to the rising price of red meat in the Egyptian market and the growing variety of fresh fish available to consumers.
Processed cheese:
Although all dried and processed foods have seen increases in the Egyptian food market, processed cheese has had the most success.
From 1998 to 2003, the sale of processed cheese increased by almost 30%.
In comparison, Canadian food exports only account for 1% of Egypt’s imported food market.
Furthermore, the United States and many European countries, specifically France, Germany, Spain and Italy, and South Africa are Egypt’s top suppliers of consumer-ready food products.
Egypt’s trade agreements with various neighbouring countries, the United States and Europe also act as major challenges to Canada’s success in the Egyptian food market.
Egypt has a strong trade relationship with the European Union (EU).
In 2004, Egypt signed and an agreement with the EU effectively lifting barriers to non-agricultural trade to Europe.
Egypt has also joined the Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZ) by signing a trilateral agreement with the United States and Israel.
This agreement is seen as a step toward the signing of a free trade agreement between Egypt and the United States in the future.
The Egyptian government also frequently applies reference prices and high tariffs on certain products such as apples and alcoholic beverages.
Although Egypt has significantly reduced import tariffs, duties on some products are still very high.
For example, most customer-oriented product tariffs are 32%, while some fruit (e.g. apples and pears) still have relatively high rates of 40%.
The Egyptian government is working to increase business activity by attracting foreign investment.
In doing so, the government is introducing reforms on economic, legal and monetary policies, and has introduced incentives and provided additional opportunities for international and bilateral trade.
Free trade zones have also been established in many Egyptian cities.
This has created excellent environments for businesses growth in Egypt’s large urban areas.
Such changes have since provided significant opportunities to foreign companies in accessing the Egyptian market.
The country’s eight main seaports handle approximately 60.5 million tons of goods per year.
Improvements to Egypt’s highways are underway, and telecommunication networks are beginning to reach global standards.
Businesses are closed Friday and Saturday.

Agriculture Sector and Policies Although Egypt spans approximately 1 million km2, its limited arable land and little annual rainfall make the agricultural industry highly dependent on various techniques to increase yield and water supply from the Nile River.
Egypt is well known for its traditional agriculture practices and activities which include basin irrigation, organic manure, crop rotation and intensification.
However, with limited usable land surface and water supply, less than 5% of land is suitable for farming.
Approximately 80% of the nation’s water supply is used for farming and a large portion of this water is provided by the Nile River.
Egypt’s agricultural sector is an integral component of its economy, accounting for 15% of GDP and employing approximately 36% of the population in 2006.
The country’s main agricultural commodities include cotton, rice, corn, wheat, beans, fruit, vegetables, cattle, water buffalo, sheep and goats.
Facing such agricultural challenges, the Egyptian government has put significant effort into implementing various agriculture policies and supporting research programs that increase crop intensification, create more efficient management of resources and agriculture inputs, and reduce negative environmental impacts.
The state recently introduced several policy reforms that ranged from eliminating controls on input and output prices, to a new crop quota structure and delivery system.

Market Information Middle East and North Africa Agriculture Sector - Market Brief - Iran January 2003
Agriculture Iran is currently one of the world's largest net importers of agricultural products, importing 30-50% of its food requirements.
The country's rapid population growth and an increase in disposable income are expected to substantially raise the demand for food over the medium and long-term, and should lead to diversification in agricultural imports.
In the Iranian year 1378 (ended 21 March 2000), the country's agricultural sector accounted for 24.8% of the GNP, 23% of job creation, 21% of non-oil exports, 80% of domestically needed foodstuffs and 90% of the raw materials used in food processing plants.
Agriculture effectively constitutes the backbone of Iranian production, and some 10.2 million hectares of land are under cultivation throughout the country.
The Ministry of Agricultural Jihad's statistics show that annual production in Iran between March 1999 and March 2000 exceeded 65 million tons.
In addition to being the largest producer of saffron and pistachios in the world, Iran is also among the top ten producers of ten other potentially exportable items.
Geographically, Iran is located between 25-40° N latitude and has a total area of 1,648,195 km2, of which 123,580 km2 suitable for agriculture.
The climatic conditions in much of Iran are typical of arid and semi-arid regions, while the Caspian coast is considered subtropical.
Nevertheless, the country has a wide spectrum of climatic, physiographic and hydrological conditions.
However, much of the arable land is devoted to growing wheat and barley, which are staple food and the main sources of protein for the average Iranian.
Wheat alone covers about 50%, while various fruits account for 15% of the total irrigated land in Iran (2000 estimate).
Two farming systems - man-made irrigation and rain-fed (dry farming) - are primarily used in different parts of the country, and the area devoted to each system varies considerably depending on agro-climatic conditions.
Rain-fed and dry farming are most successful in western and northwestern Iran, as well as the lowlands along the Caspian coast.
In other parts of the country, dry farming is also practiced in hilly areas, but the yields are limited.
In the central plateau, as well as the southern plains and the southern coastal areas of Iran, crop production is mostly possible only with irrigation, due to low rainfall and high evaporation rates.
In some low-lying plains in the central plateau, the annual rainfall is about 50mm while the annual evaporation may exceed 4000mm.
The country-wide average precipitation is about 250mm a year.
The table below shows the area of land under cultivation (1996-2001).
Crop year Land under Annual Cops (1,000 hectares)
Of this, about 10.2 million hectares is cultivated (irrigated and rain-fed), while nearly 5.8 million hectares is left fallow every year.
An estimated 32 million hectares of unused land are potentially suitable for crop production, but a shortage of water resources limits their agricultural role.
It is important to take into account that more than half of the country consists of rangeland (generally of low to medium productivity), wasteland, and mountains.
Sand dunes, salt flats, and other non-productive land, found mostly in the central plateau and the southern coastal areas, comprise 11.6 million hectares.
The main crops produced by Iranian farmers are grains such as wheat, rice, and barley.
Due to special programs initiated in the agricultural sector, Iran has become more or less self-sufficient in the production of several farm products, including certain fruits, vegetables, and livestock.
Nevertheless, Iran remains a net importer of foodstuffs, due in part to the drought that has affected the country for the last few years.
The following tables indicate the major sources of Iran's agricultural products and the total import values.
Main Sources of Iranian Agricultural Imports Product Source Country Oil Argentina Brazil Canada U.A.E Oil seeds Canada Brazil U.A.E Netherlands Pulses Canada Pakistan Iraq U.A.E Other agricultural products (wheat, barley, corn, etc.)
Canada Australia Kazakhstan Thailand Argentina
The major importer of wheat is the Government Trading Company (GTC), which has traditionally worked with the GTCs of exporting countries.
However, recently enacted regulations have allowed for private companies' import of raw wheat, as long as it is processed in Iran and then re-exported, with the firm profiting from the added value of the processed product.
Wheat production, like other agricultural activities, currently benefits from large state subsidies, and although the government is planning to reduce their assistance, wheat will be the last to be affected, as it is the staple grain in the diets of most Iranians.
Since the record crop of 3.3 million tons of barley in 1988, acreage and production have been steadily decreasing and imports have increased.
While Canada has sold quantities of barley to Iran in the past, annual exports have not exceeded 200,000 tons since 1989-1990.
For the 1999-2000 fiscal year, domestic barley production decreased to 1.4 million tons, and the following year, Iran imported 1.05 million tons worth US$160 million.
Canada's share of the total barley import during the latter period was 165,500 tons.
Corn has been gaining significance in its use as a feed grain since 1974.
As very little corn is produced domestically, imports have increased at the same pace as feed use.
During 2000-2001, some 1.2 million tons, worth US$151 million, were imported, and Canada's share of the total was 0.38 million tons.
While Iranians consume over 1 million tons of edible oils annually, they produce only about 240,000 tons, therefore requiring a large amount of imports.
Soybean imports are also of significant quantities, and the demand for canola seeds and oil is ever growing.
The estimated 1 million tons of imports come in the form of seeds as opposed to oils, since the government's Third 5-Year Economic Development Plan(1) states that in order to support domestic employment and to economize on foreign exchange reserves, oil seeds or oil cake should be imported instead of processed edible oils.
The various forms of edible oil imported by Iran and the main sources are as follows:
• Soya oil (raw)
• Peanut oil (refined)
• Olive Oil
• Palm Oil (raw)
• Sunflower Oil (raw and refined)
• Cotton seed oil (raw and refined)
• Coconut oil (raw and refined)
• Date seed oil (raw and refined)
• Linseed oil (raw and refined)
• Animal oils Rice:
Rice is an important part of the Iranian diet, and in 1999-2000 it was the fourth largest crop grown in the country in terms of volume.
While production has been steadily increasing from year to year, production in 1999-2000 experienced a slight decrease due to the drought.
While Iran produces dry beans, chickpeas, lentils and millet, though imports are required when production is not sufficient.
The country's pulse market amounts to 512,000 metric tons per year, valued at approximately US$500 million.
The annual production of various crops in Iran (1997-2000) is indicated in the table below.
Source Country Wheat Barley
Although traditionally migratory tribes have maintained large herds of sheep and goats and small farms have produced both meat and milk, the higher demand for meat has prompted a move toward the widespread establishment of large-scale industrial farms.
Domestic production of meat (lamb, chicken, beef and goat) totals almost 2 million tons annually, which is all but sufficient to meet internal demand.
However, some imports of various types of meat (excluding pork) are allowed in order to maintain price stability.
In addition, with the continued expansion of industrial farming both for dairy and meat production, the need for genetic materials has also increased significantly.
The following points indicate Iran's potential for attracting foreign involvement.
• There are several large-scale, state-owned agricultural enterprises that can be offered to the local or foreign private sector.
• Export opportunities available to foreign companies (investors) are enhanced by Iran's geographic location and the fact that agriculture in the surrounding regions (Persian Gulf States, Caucasus and Central Asian Republics) has not traditionally flourished.
• Imports of seeds, pesticides and agricultural machinery help create foreign investment opportunities.
• An ever-increasing need to upgrade technical knowledge, improve quality and increase productivity set the stage for foreign involvement.
• There are excellent opportunities for foreign companies in Iran's agriculture sector, including the establishment of irrigation and forestation systems.
• In the past two decades, the Iranian government has put emphasis on supporting the industry and is determined to continue to do so in the future.
Foreign companies, by forming joint ventures with Iranian entities, can also benefit from other services such as bank loan privileges and export tax exemptions.
Bank services related to agriculture are usually rendered through Bank Keshavarzi.
The interest this bank charges is the lowest, when compared to the rates charged to the country's other economic activities, such as construction, industry and services.
The Third 5-Year Economic Development Plan (2000-2005) specifies that the government should allocate 25% of bank loans provided for Iran's development, to the water and agriculture sectors.
Foreign manufacturers of agricultural equipment and machinery can export their products to Iran or, in partnership with Iranian firms, can produce or assemble their products within the country.
Imports are not generally encouraged by the Iranian government and can be subject to high taxes, tariffs and charges.
In addition, in order to realize maximum growth - a point stipulated by the Plan for the water and agriculture sectors - the following factors should be given priority:
• The provision of agriculture machinery and improving the efficiency of existing machinery and equipment, thereby easing and eventually eliminating the mechanization crisis.
• The construction of water pump stations to be designed using the latest technological and engineering techniques.
The above clearly indicates that there are opportunities for foreign investors and companies to introduce their products and technology to Iran.
However, if the country's production cannot meet domestic demand, products can be imported into the country with the approval of the Ministries of Commerce and Agricultural Jihad.
The import of agricultural machinery is also allowed, but is conditional to the fact that the Ministry of Commerce has issued the relevant permits.
At the moment, there are only few items, e.g. opium, whose import is prohibited by law.
Nevertheless, the Third Development Plan states "In order to create employment opportunities and reduce foreign currency expenses, the government shall be duty-bound to import oil seeds into the country, instead of the imports of cooking oil and oil cake".
In addition, the Ministry of Agricultural Jihad has the power to stop issuing, or rescind, import permits if it deems such action appropriate.
The export of agricultural products can be subject to some limitations if the producer has been provided with subsidies.

The Iranian government's development policy has revolved around a series of Five-Year Plans.
Dating back to the 1950's, these plans are known to be extremely macro-oriented and centrally planned, aimed at achieving targeted outputs and expenditures.

MARKET OVERVIEW Israel offers a sophisticated and diversified market for agri-food products.
The United States accounts for approximately 30% of agri-food imports.
Canada is currently Israel's top supplier of dried leguminous vegetables and among the top three suppliers of soybeans and pet food.
Approximately 80% of Israel's domestically produced agriculture goods come from two types of co-operative agriculture settlements: the kibbutz, a collective entity based on co-operative principles; and the moshav, a village of family businesses in which each household earns money from their own products but work as a collective co-operative when purchasing and marketing products.
Israel has a large and sophisticated food-processing industry that provides a broad array of food products.
The leading manufacturers include Tnuva Food Industries, Elite Industries Ltd., Osem, Strauss Dairies, Israel Edible Products (TAMI), Tivall and the Meir Ezra Group.
The Israeli food market is moving toward a trend in convenience as evidenced by the many Israelis who are eating more prepared foods, fast foods, and snacks.
Demand for prepared and packaged food products is therefore strong throughout the country.
With continued growth projected for the private-label industry, significant opportunities exist for Canadian manufacturers in nearly all product categories.
The Canada Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) which came into effect on January 1, 1997, improves market access for agri-food products of export interest to both Canada and Israel.
Canada's goals are to expand coverage of the CIFTA and secure longer-term opportunities for Canadian agri-food products in key areas such as vitamins, potatoes and pet food.
Israel has a liberal import policy and has entered into free trade agreements (FTAs) with several countries other than Canada, including: the Czech Republic, the European Free Trade Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), the European Union, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Turkey and the United States.
Import licences have been eliminated, although imported food items require the approval of the Ministry of Health's Food Inspection Service.
This agency is also responsible for labelling and packaging requirements.
All plant material requires approval from the Plant Protection and Inspection Agency.
Imported meat must be licensed by Israel Veterinary Services (IVS) and originate from a processing plant that has been approved by the IVS.
Israeli law requires all meat and poultry imports be certified kosher(3) by the Rabbinical Council of the Chief Rabbinate, or a body authorized by the council.
Hence, goods can receive kosher certifications from rabbis in Canada but only with the concurrence of the Chief Rabbinate.
Kosher is an important consideration in the export of food to Israel.
With over 60% of the country's five million Jewish population maintaining some degree of Kosher observance and a Moslem population of one million purchasing Kosher food that meets the halal dietary requirement, Israel is the largest market in the world for kosher food.
Although the import of non-kosher food is not forbidden, marketing would be limited to a small segment of the market.
The large food chains, processing plants and institutional market import only kosher food.
Non kosher foods account for less than 5% of the total food market.
Exporters who wish to maximize their market presence should comply with the Chief Rabbinate requirements.
Israel has strict marking and labelling requirements.
All labels must be in Hebrew and any English lettering appearing on the label must not be larger than the Hebrew characters.
Imported food products are subject to standards issued by the Standards Institution of Israel (SII) and the Ministry of Health's Food Control Services.
With the exception of fresh fruits and vegetables, all imported products are subject to a value added tax of 18%, which is levied on the cost, insurance and freight, landed cost plus purchase tax.
Good representation is the key to the Israeli market.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is well connected with key players.
For assistance in locating an agent or distributor, contact the Canadian Embassy in Israel.
For more information on import regulations, see the Israel Agri-Food Market Report available online at: www.infoexport.gc.ca
OPPORTUNITIES Canadian agri-food products are well-positioned to penetrate the Israeli market.
A significant number of Canadian food manufacturers produce kosher food products including bakery products and ingredients, confectionery products, fish (especially salmon), soybean meal, honey, and packaged food products and meals.
In addition to pulses, non-durum wheat, barley, and soya beans, which Canada has traditionally exported to this market, there are numerous and varied opportunities in the following areas:
• prepared foods-cereals, health snacks, savoury snacks, sauces, spreads
• fish and seafood products-high-quality fish such as salmon, sole and seafood for the restaurant market
• confectionery products-chocolates, chewing gum, candies, sweet biscuits
• bakery products-prepared snacks, consumer-ready dried food products
• frozen meals, frozen fruits, especially frozen berries for the dairy industry
• wines-market demand has risen substantially.
Canadian wine--especially ice wine--is well-placed to develop a market share in Israel.
The private-label market offers opportunities as well.
Private labels represent 5% of the major supermarkets volume and is expected to double within the next year.
Canada's "President's Choice" private label has enjoyed considerable success in the Israeli market over the past several years.
KEY PARTICIPANTS In recent years, a number of multinational firms such as Nestlé, Pillsbury, Best Foods, Unilever, Yoplait, Danone, Knorr and Cadbury Schweppes PLC have successfully entered the market through licensing agreements or in partnership with local food producers.
Canadian companies have a solid presence in the Israeli agri-food market and have developed an excellent reputation as dependable suppliers.
In addition, Canadian companies have also made significant inroads into the Israeli private-label market over the past few years.
Solid examples abound on the shelves of Clubmarket, one of Israeli's largest food chains, which sources a significant array of President's Choice (PC) private label brand from Canada.
Canada's main competitors in Israel are the European Union, which accounted for 39% of total food imports in 2001and the United States (24%).
However, new trading partners such as Turkey and countries from the former Soviet Union have significantly increased their trade with Israel in recent years.
The United States has traditionally maintained a strong presence in the Israeli agri-food market, having tariff advantages over some Canadian agri-food products.
PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Israel has a diverse import system, ranging from small two to three persons operations that contract out distribution, to large companies offering full marketing and logistical services.
Most importers prefer exclusivity, particularly for new products.
However, large international firms often use multiple importers for distribution.
With approximately 60% of the market share, Israeli supermarkets dominate Israel's retail food sector.
Israel's leading supermarket chain is Super-Sol Ltd. which operates over 140 stores throughout Israel.
The chain operates a variety of supermarket formats including Cosmos and Super-Sol, which are large urban supermarkets; Hyper-Netto, discount food stores; Seven Universe Club, club-member superstores; and Birkat Rachel, a discount chain of supermarkets specializing in kosher products for Israel's ultra orthodox community.
SuperSol purchases most of its imports from Israeli importers but operates one central distribution centre from which they deliver products to various stores in the chain.
Blue Square Ltd., Supersol's major competitor, has over 170 stores in Israel including 12 Mega hypermarket outlets.
Other retail formats run by the chain include Super Centre, the company's discount supermarket chain; King- Centre, a smaller version of hard discount-format retail centres; Super Centre City, neighbourhood stores based on the Super Centre model, and Co-Op, medium-sized convenience stores (generally found in Tel Aviv).
Like Super-Sol's Birkat Rachel, Blue Square's Shefa Mehadrin chain also caters to Israel's ultra-orthodox population.
The chain purchases most of its imports from Israeli importers although some high-volume, high turnover items, which do not demand a long warehousing period, are imported directly.
With over 160 stores, Clubmarket Ltd. is Israel's third-largest food chain.
Like its competitors, it operates several retail formats including Clubmarket, its flagship discount supermarket chain; Co-Op, a large chain of convenience stores; Hyperzol, chain of discount stores; Glatmarket, discount food stores targeted to ultra-orthodox consumers; Metro, mega-store specializing in discount wholesale trading; Rav Mecher discount retail stores; Jumbo, large hypermarkets, and Franchisees, a sub-chain of small neighbourhood stores operated via franchisees.

MARKET OVERVIEW Biopharmaceuticals is the most significant sector of the Israeli biotechnology market.
Domestic biotechnology companies focus mainly on product development for cancer, auto-immune syndromes and neurology disorders and to a lesser extent, on food, cosmetics and environmental products.
About 50% of university research projects in therapeutics and 66% of biotech drugs in the pipeline are in the areas of auto-immune diseases, neurology and cancer.
Pharmaceutical and diagnostics firms represent 72% of the Israeli biotechnology industry, agricultural biotechnology accounts for 20%, and the remainder includes veterinary and environmental applications.
Sales revenues of biotechnology industry are estimated at $2.6 billion(1) in 2003.
Investments in Israel were estimated at $1.4 billion.
Furthermore by 2010 Israel is expected to account for 3% of the global biotech market.
There is strong government support for the biotechnology industry within Israel through programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators, and encourage bi-national cooperation.
However, Israel lacks regulatory infrastructure.
Despite a rapidly expanding medical and pharmaceutical industry, the Israeli market is dependent on imported goods.
The pharmaceutical market, including generic drugs, was valued at $1.7 billion in 2002, 50% of which were imported drugs.
Israel's biotechnology industry is still in its infancy with 150 companies, including about 40 incubator projects and approximately 3500 employees.
The majority of the companies focus on biopharmaceuticals.
Three quarters of the companies are small start-ups with less than 20 employees while a dozen companies represent 80% of the total market value of the industry, generate two thirds of sales and employ about 50% of the industry's workforce.
In the last decade, the number of companies increased by an average of 17% per year, while the sales generated by the sector grew by 27% per year.
The challenge for the industry will be to move to the next phase of growth in which it nurtures more broadly based companies, supported by the physical, regulatory and scientific infrastructure necessary for long term growth.
The Ministry of Science, Culture and Sports(2) and the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Industry and Trade supports the Israeli biotech industry by providing long-term financial support for research and development (R&D) projects to biotech companies, enhancing cooperation between academia and industry to ward the commercialization of Israeli biotechnology worldwide, by encouraging international strategic cooperation and by assisting start-ups through a variety of support activities including incubators.
In the life sciences field, there are seven universities, five technical colleges and ten specialized research institutes engaged in advanced biotechnological research.
An estimated 35% of all academic scientists in Israel work in the life sciences field and spend 40-50% of all academic research funding.
As a result, Israel has one of the world's most skilled and educated work forces, with more doctors, scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation.
Israel has a highly diverse population as a result of years of immigration, providing researchers with a heterogenous population for clinical trial research.
Lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world, makes Israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships.
Opportunities There are good opportunities in this market for Canadian companies interested in R&D partnerships and technology transfer agreements to take advantage of Israel's research strengths.
Areas where major advances in biotechnology have been made include the use of molecular modeling to design new and improved drugs, synthetic polyamino acids for drug development, drug delivery techniques and drug design by peptide modification.
Israel needs to invest further in the essential infrastructure to compete in the post-genomic era, especially in basic research infrastructure and early stage commercialization.
Currently, Israeli biotechnology firms tend to sell their early stage technology to international investors or multinational concerns, rather than take the risk to develop the product further.
There is scope for combining Canadian and Israeli talents where Canadian biotechnology companies can form strategic partnerships with Israeli companies, both at the pre- and post-commercialization stages.
Due to insufficient industrial infrastructure facilities for drug development and testing, there are market opportunities for Canadian companies to provide these services.
Canadian companies can also work co-operatively with Israeli companies to conduct clinical trials in Israel where there is a high level of medical expertise, lower costs and a diverse population base.
The Canada-Israel Industrial Research Development Foundation (CIIRDF) provides companies in either country with an introductory service for the purpose of creating R&D alliances.
The program contributes half of the costs of joint R&D projects (up to $50 000 over one year for approved pilot projects and up to $750 000 over three years to fund approved full-scale projects) for eligible Canadian or Israeli firms operating and headquartered in either Canada or Israel.
At least 30% of the cash cost of any individual project must be spent in either Canada or Israel, contributions are repayable from commercial revenues from the project.
For further information, Canadian companies should contact CIIRDF.
Canadian companies interested in research and development relationships with Israeli companies are encouraged to consult the MATIMOP program.
MATIMOP (Israeli Industry Center for Research and Development) is a public non-profit organization that promotes joint industrial development of advanced technologies.
The program's Web site (http://www2.matimop.org.il) contains a database outlining co-operative program opportunities that span a range of advanced technologies.
Key Trade Shows BIO-TECH ISRAEL May 4-6, 2004 - Israel's 3rd National Biotechnology Week (http://www.kenes.com/biotech/prog.htm). The exhibition has always attracted large numbers of exhibiting companies representing the entire spectrum of biotechnology related products and services.
The Bio-Technology Conference and the Exhibition will be held at the David-Intercontinental Hotel, Tel Aviv.
For more information, contact the Canadian Embassy.
KEY PARTICIPANTS Israel is expected to become a major centre for the development of pharmaceuticals, especially generic brands.
However, in spite of recent growth, the Israeli pharmaceutical market remains relatively small and the Israeli biotechnology industry has yet to achieve the level of the development of its international competitors, particularly in the United States, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom.
The two main producers and importers of biopharmacuticals are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Agis Industries which together have a combined market share in Israel of 50%-60%.
Other major biotechnology companies in Israel include Biotechnology General (BTG), Pharmos, Interpharm (IPL) and Compugen.
PRIVATE-AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS In 1998, Israel reformed its drug import regulations to include major changes in pricing, importing and approvals for new drugs.
For example, medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medical Regulations Agency will be approved by the Ministry of Health in Israel much more quickly than those that have not received such approval.
The FDA and the Israel Ministry of Health have signed a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) to enable full acceptance and recognition by the FDA of clinical trials conducted in Israel for new drugs and medical devices.
Despite objections from international biopharmaceutical companies, Israel has allowed parallel drug imports since September 2000.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Israeli biotechnology market is a small, emerging market with an estimated value of $1.7 billion1.
The industry comprises 160 companies and employs 4000 people.
In 2001, Israel's biotech sector received approximately $428.6 million in venture capital, an increase of 42% from 2000.
Israel's biotech strengths are in therapeutic pharmaceuticals, bio-informatics, agro-bio (animal and plant products) and diagnostics.
Israel has a highly diverse population, providing researchers with a heterogenous population for clinical trial research.
Lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world make Israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships.
The best prospects for growth in the Israeli biotech industry are in bio-electronics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, bio-informatics and structure-based drug design.
Opportunities are also available in the growing agricultural biotech sector, where research is focussed primarily on the development of seeds and transgenic plants.
Fish cultures and algae are also growing research areas.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is well-connected with key players.
MARKET OVERVIEW Israel offers a sophisticated and diversified marketplace for goods and services.
Despite its relatively small population of six million people, Israel is still a country with a high volume of imports (both raw materials and finished goods).
The Israeli biotechnology market was worth an estimated $1.7 billion in 2001 and is forecast to reach $2.9 billion by the end of 2003, with continued growth expected over the long term.
In 2001, Israel's biotech sector received approximately $428.6 million in venture capital; an increase of 42% from 2000.
The Israeli government strongly supports the biotech industry with programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators and encourage international cooperation.

Realizing its Full Potential," 2002.
Downloaded from www.irc.org.il/biotech/Vernia.htm on February 12, 2003 The Israeli biotech industry has yet to achieve the level of maturity and development of its competitors, particularly when compared to the United States, Canada, Germany or the United Kingdom.
The potential for progress, however, is significant because of strong government support and the emergence of several large- and medium-sized firms with sufficient infrastructure to develop and test new products.
The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) of the Ministry of Industry and Trade2 as well as the Ministry of Science, Culture and Sport are responsible for biotech development in the country.
Although there are several academic and research institutes in Israel, most of the country's biotech research and development (R&D) is centred around the Weizmann Institute of Science and four universities:
Agricultural Biotechnology Agricultural and veterinarian products account for 23% of the biotech market in Israel and over 40% of country's total biotech exports are in agricultural biotechnology.
Approximately 80% of research in this sector is devoted to plant biotechnology, particularly the development of seeds and transgenic plants as well as bio-pest control.
The remaining 20% is focussed on veterinarian biotechnology.
Although genetically modified (GM) crops and food products are a significant topic of public debate in Israel, the government has not yet issued a policy on GM organisms.
A number of domestic companies are active in agricultural biotechnology including Abic BioBee, AgroGreen, Hazera, Gedera, Rahan Meristem, Vitality and Zeraim.
Most agricultural research is conducted at the Volcani Institute and the Hebrew University Faculty of Agriculture.
Diagnostics Diagnostics account for 4% of Israel's biotech market but is expected to grow in the coming years.
Most of this area of biotechnology is focussed on immunological and genetic assays for pathogens.
Leading local companies include Gamida-Gen, Orgenics, Rahan Meristem and Savyon.
Medical Biotechnology Biopharmaceuticals are the most significant sector of the Israeli biotech market.
However, the distinction between traditional pharmaceutical firms and those employing biotechnology in the development of medical products is difficult to establish.
Therapeutic pharmaceuticals account for 67% of total biotech sales in the country.
The three leading therapeutic areas in Israel include neurology disorders, cancer and auto-immune systems disorders; approximately 66% of biotech drugs produced are in these areas.
Other products under development currently include recombinant heparanase, cell therapies for spinal cord traumas, human monoclonal antibodies, structurally shaped peptides and new drug generations.
There were 36 domestic firms working in this sector in 2001.
Leading companies include Pharmos, Peptor Ltd., Insight, Omri, XTL Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceuticals, D-Pharm, QBI Enterprises, Keryx Biopharmaceuticals and Proneuron Biotechnologies.
With sales totalling $87 million annually, Swiss-owned InterPharm is the leading multinational in Israel's biopharmaceutical market.
In spite of a rapidly expanding medical industry, the Israeli market is still quite dependent on imported goods.
Imported pharmaceuticals accounted for approximately 50% of the $1.7 billion market in 2001.
Imports primarily originate from the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom; Canadian imports have had a marginal share of about 1% in recent years.
Key Factors Shaping Market Growth Despite a thriving venture capital sector and a world-renown academic infrastructure, Israel's full potential in biotechnology has not been realized.
However, the biotech industry is now on the government's national agenda and a strategy has been devised to support its growth over the next 10 years.
There is strong government support for the biotech industry within Israel through programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators3 and encourage international co-operation.
According to the Israeli Industry Center for Research and Development (MATIMOP), the Office of the Chief Scientist has established priority areas for the new biotech initiative:
• establishing two world-class incubators dedicated solely to biotechnology;
• improving and expanding the industry's physical infrastructure; and
• providing funding, through the OCS-run NOFAR program4.
Israel has a highly diverse population as a result of years of immigration, providing researchers a heterogenous population for clinical trial research.
Lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world make Israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships.
Opportunities The Israeli biotech market is a small, emerging market that holds significant opportunities for Canadian companies, especially in strategic partnering with Israeli biotech companies for joint R&D and international marketing.
Analysts predict that by the end of 2003, the number of biotech companies in Israel will jump from 160 to as many as 250.
Israel is expected to become a centre for the development of biopharmaceuticals and generic medications.
The best prospects for growth in the industry are in bioelectronics, nanotechnology, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, bio-informatics and structure-based drug design.
The growing agricultural biotech sector also holds potential for Canadian companies.
Genetically developed hybrid seeds for fruits, vegetables and cotton, as well as fish cultures and algae are currently the main areas of research.
Currently, Israeli biotech firms tend to sell their early-stage technology to international investors or multinational concerns, rather than take the risk to develop the product further.
Combining Canadian and Israeli talents could see additional development in both countries within this sector.
Canadian companies interested in fostering R&D relationships with Israeli companies are encouraged to consult the Web site of the Israeli Industry Center for Research and Development (MATIMOP).
MATIMOP is a public non-profit organization that promotes collaborations for the development of advanced technologies.
The Web site www.matimop.org.il contains a database outlining co-operative program opportunities that span a range of advanced technologies.
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT Local Capabilities In the life sciences field, there are seven universities, five technical colleges and ten specialized research institutes engaged in advanced biotechnological research.
An estimated 35% of all academic scientists in Israel work in the life sciences field and approximately 60% of Israeli scientific publications are focussed on agricultural or health-related fields.
As a result, Israel has one of the world's most skilled and educated work forces, having more doctors, scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation.
Areas where major advances in biotechnology have been made include the use of molecular modelling to design new and improved drugs, synthetic polyamino acids for drug development, drug delivery techniques and drug design by peptide modification.
Israel accounts for 2.5% of biotech sales in the world and is second only to the United States in terms of new, start-up biotech companies.
International Competition Israel has signed international co-operation agreements with governments from Canada, Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom and Korea to encourage collaboration for biotech R&D.
Canadian Position Canadian biotech companies are well-positioned to provide joint-venture partnerships, public education initiatives, and commercialization expertise to the Israeli biotech industry, as well as a broad range of products resulting from Canada's R&D efforts.
Canada's strengths in applying biotechnology to agricultural commercialization may be of interest to Israeli producers and researchers.
The Canadian agricultural biotech industry has already received government approval for a number of genetically altered products.
Several Canadian companies have found success in the Israeli biotech market through collaborations with local companies:
• Montreal-based Q-biogene and BioLabs of Jerusalem have together developed a reagent kit for use in gene therapy research;
• Diagnocure (Quebec City) and Compugen (Tel Aviv) are collaborating on the development of a nucleic acid, probe-based diagnostic kit for early detection of lung cancer;
• Bioxel Pharma (Quebec City) and Jerusalem-based Polygene are developing polymeric implants for the delivery of anti-cancer drugs to localized tumor sites; and
• Mikro-Tech (Timmins, Ontario) and Rahan Meristem (Kibbutz Rosh Hanikra) entered into a joint venture to improve the quality of plants propagated from seed or from tissue cultures.
Competitive Advantage through Canadian Government Policies and Initiatives Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement The 1997 Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) improves market access for products of export interest to both Canada and Israel and eliminates virtually all tariffs on industrial goods.
It has partially restored Canada's competitive position in the Israeli market, where the United States and European Union have gained preferential access through negotiated bilateral agreements.
Canadian exports have increased by 30% since the CIFTA came into effect.
Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation The Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation (CIIRDF), established in 1994 to promote collaborative, bilateral R&D, helps Canadian companies create bilateral links with Israeli partners.
A critical connection to accelerate this new strategy will be made in Israel, courtesy of the MAGNET program.
In the identified technology areas, CIIRDF will prepare step-by-step roadmaps and organize annual Canada-Israel roundtables aimed at identifying priority opportunities for co-operative projects.
Canadian Commercial Corporation The Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) gives Canadian companies access to financing and better payment terms under the Progress Payment Program (PPP).
Activity costs are shared on a pre-approved, 50/50 basis.
The PEMD refundable contribution ranges from $5000 to a maximum of $50 000.
Preference is given to companies with fewer than 100 employees for a firm in the manufacturing sector and 50 in the service industry, or with annual sales between $250 000 and $10 million.
Other components of the program include international bid preparation (Capital Projects Bidding) and, for trade associations, developing international marketing activities for their membership.

Virtual Trade Commissioner The Virtual Trade Commissioner (vTC) is a new on-line service offered by Canada's Trade Commissioner Service of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
The vTC offers registered users direct on-line access to market information, including market reports, business news, events and business leads related to the companies' industry sectors and markets of interest.
Canadian exporters can register for a Virtual Trade Commissioner at www.infoexport.gc.ca.
PRIVATE-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Israel's 630 privately owned pharmacies represent the second-largest group of customers for pharmaceutical products (the publicly funded health-care system is the primary customer).
The two largest drug store chains are SuperPharm and NewPharm.
The public sector consumes 90% of both imported and locally produced pharmaceuticals.
Since 1995, health insurance is guaranteed to all Israeli citizens.
All residents are required to register with one of the health-care organizations, which provide a standard and extensively subsidized selection of health services and drugs through one of four public "sick funds".
The largest of the sick funds, Kupat Holim Clalit, is the primary purchaser of drugs in Israel.
The other sick funds include Macabi, Leummit and Meuhedet.
The country's sick funds account for approximately 80% of total pharmaceutical expenditure in Israel; the remaining 20% is divided among the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Health and the private sector.
Government Organizations The Ministry of Health is responsible for Israel's overall health policy and for providing direct services to the public through the operation of autonomous heath-care units.
Participation at annual trade fairs can help to develop company and product exposure to this market segment.
Eilat is home to the country's only free-trade zone.
All major ports offer good-quality warehousing but growing demand has rendered capacity problems.
Israel has 610 kilometres of standard gauge railway and 15 965 km of highways.
There are eight main airports located primarily in the largest cities; Ben-Gurion International Airport is the largest.
Channels of Distribution Good representation is the key to success in the Israeli market.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is well-connected with key players.
Importers, Agents and Distributors Exporters new to the Israeli market are advised to appoint a local agent that has an understanding of the local market, good contacts with the Ministry of Health, the sick funds and other major players, and the ability to promote products effectively.
There is an unspoken understanding and trust within Israel's business community that welcomes foreign partners and sales, but looks for a local who "knows you."
An importer of pharmaceutical products must have a licence and be a resident of Israel, or be a representative of a corporation registered in Israel.
As a result, Canadian companies must either establish an office in Israel, or hire a distributor for their products.
For assistance locating an agent or distributor, contact the Canadian Embassy in Israel.
Many other languages are also spoken.
The business environment is westernized but likely to be less formal in both dress (especially during the summer months) and the use of first names without titles.
Increasingly, businesses are moving toward a five-day working week, from Sunday until Thursday.
Common office hours are from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and from 8 a.m. until 1 p.m. on Friday.
The financial sector is modern and efficient with a full range of financial institutions and instruments.
There are few restrictions on foreign investment and investors and the regulatory environment and tax system favour foreign companies and investors.
The Consular Affairs Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's (DFAIT) provides country-specific travel information reports and advisories at www.voyage.gc.ca/destinations/menu_e.htm. Canadians travelling to Israel should pay particular attention to their personal security and follow news reports carefully, as the security situation can change rapidly.
Import Regulations The Government of Israel requires that food and health products be registered with the Ministry of Health before they can be sold in the country.
Sanitary regulations are governed by mutual agreements under membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The Ministry of Health imposes strict controls on the importation of pharmaceuticals.
Medical drugs and substances for their preparation may be imported only through a licence holder who is either an Israeli resident or a representative of a company registered in Israel.
To obtain a licence, a Registration of Medicinal Products must be submitted to the Ministry of Health.
Since 1998, there has been a concerted effort to speed up the approval process for drugs imported from Canada, the United States, the European Union, Japan and Australia.
Accordingly, drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medical Regulation Agency will be licensed by the Ministry within two months, rather than the usual four-month period.
Free trade agreements have been signed by Israel with the European Union (1975), the United States (1985), the European Free Trade Alliance (1992) and Canada (1997).
Under these agreements, there are no custom duties on pharmaceutical imports from these trading partners.
Most imports are free of licensing and quantitative restrictions.
All imports are subject to a 15% cost, insurance, freight value port fee, as well as a 18% value-added tax (VAT).
The VAT is recovered by the importer upon the resale of the goods and is paid ultimately by the consumer, in the final retail price.
The Israeli government has not yet issued a formal policy on GM organisms (GMOs).
However, the country follows the European model for GMO labelling, whereby products containing over 1% of protein or DNA from a modified organism must be labelled as such.
Intellectual Property Protection Israel is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Patent Co-operation Treaty, the Universal Copyright Convention and the Berne Copyright Convention.
As a member of the WTO, Israel complies with the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement.
Patents Israeli patent laws protect both the process and the product and is granted for 20 years from the date of the application, subject to payment of renewal fees.
The owner of a patent must provide a local address when applying for a patent and the title must appear in both Hebrew and English (specifications, however, may be in either English or Hebrew).
The "first to file" principal applies, whereby the first or prior use of a patent does not protect the owner from infringement by someone else who applies first for a patent in Israel.
The use of the services of a patent attorney is recommended.
Generic Drugs Through 1998 and 1999, Israel amended its patent laws to permit domestic manufacturers of generic drugs to develop generic versions of patented drugs prior to the expiration of the 20-year patent protection for the innovator.
While the laws restrict production for use in research and for filing applications to regulatory authorities, Israel has no effective safeguards to restrict commercial exports.
The Israeli pharmaceutical market relied previously on licensed technology from foreign companies, or had to license their technology to large-scale manufacturers.
Israeli generic drug manufacturers have now become large enough to undertake the commercial development of pharmaceuticals.
These companies are opposed to any delay in R&D until after the full period of patent protection has expired.
The revised Israeli patent laws allow Israeli generic alternatives to be marketed as soon as the patent expires, when Israel's competitors would only be starting development of alternatives.
This gives Israeli companies a jump start on generic drug competitors, and generally results in Israeli generic manufacturers gaining a larger portion of the market.
Fearing the erosion of their competitive advantage, the United States and the European Union oppose Israel's revised patent laws and are considering taking the matter to the under the TRIPS Agreement.
Furthermore, the European Union and the United States do not allow imports of generics while the patented drug is still protected and have threatened sanctions against Israel over Israel's interpretation of the TRIPS Agreement.
This objection, however, will not prevent other nations from purchasing Israeli exports.
Canadian exporters are advised to follow this issue closely and take all necessary precautions to protect intellectual property.
Trademarks Applications for trademark protection may be made by the owner or their agent with written authorization from the owner.
All applicants must present a local address and pay the required fee of approximately $200.
The term of trademark protection is seven years but is renewable indefinitely for periods of 14 years upon payment of required fees.
Priority of registration is given to the first local user of the trademark and every application must specify goods or services falling within one class only.
Under the terms of the Paris Convention, where an application to register a trade or service mark in another signatory country has been made, the applicant has a right to claim priority for registration of the same trademark in Israel for the same use.
Local Standards, Certificates or Registrations Standard documentation includes a certificate of origin, a commercial invoice and a bill of lading.
All imports into Israel must have a label indicating the content, weight and volume of the shipment, the country of origin, the name and address of the producer and the Israeli importer.
In all instances Hebrew must be used.
English may be added provided it appears no larger than the Hebrew print.
In addition, specific labelling regulations may apply to various types of pharmaceuticals.
Exporters are advised to consult with Israeli authorities or their local agent/importer to obtain specific requirements.
Export Credit Risks, Restrictions on Letters of Credit, Currency Controls Despite the security situation and political upheavals, conditions for financing in Israel remain favourable.
Payment is usually done through a letter of credit.
Credit terms last 60-90 days.
In cases where distribution arrangements are concluded, exporters are advised to prepare a contract detailing all major points of agreement, rights and responsibilities.
Local currency delays are, on average, one month.
Although local currency payments are generally made by importers within two weeks, foreign exchange delays of two months are reported.
The current import cover is 5.8 months.

Market Information Middle East and North Africa Agri-Food Sector Profile(1) - Lebanon July 2003
Canadian Embassy in Beirut 43 Jal el Dib Highway Beirut, Lebanon Contact:
MARKET OVERVIEW Lebanon's agriculture sector accounts for 13% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs an estimated 13% of the country's labour force.
About 70% of Lebanon's food needs are satisfied by imports and the diversity of imported food items is quite remarkable.
Although Lebanon's agriculture sector has the potential to be one of the most productive in the region, it is underdeveloped and poorly managed.
Only 55% of the productive areas are exploited, often in an inefficient and wasteful manner.
Major crops include vegetables, (tomatoes, potatoes), fruits (citrus fruit, bananas, grapes, apples), olives, tobacco, cereals (mainly wheat).
The major agriculture industries are wine (expected to grow at between 5% and 10% a year), olive oil and table olives, and dairy milk production.
The agriculture sector suffers from lack of funding, receiving just 0.33% of the state budget in 2002.
Private-sector finance, is equally limited, with bank loans to agriculture accounting for only 2% of bank credits.
The government has also introduced Export Plus, a subsidy program aimed at assisting agriculture exporters with their crops (vegetables, fruit, flowers and eggs).
Agri-food transformation/food processing (mainly for fruit and vegetables), once considered to be a major part of Lebanon's agriculture and agri-food industry, is almost non-existent and requires substantial rebuilding.
The local distribution market suffers from the absence of government quality control, a lack of marketing regulations, and competition from lower-priced products from border and neighbouring countries.
For the size of the Lebanese economy, the quantity and diversity of food imports are impressive.
In this small country, food imports range from basic food categories to the finest foods, wines and spirits.
Total food imports are estimated at almost $2 million(2) (US $1.3 million) for 2002.
Major Canadian agri-food products exported to Lebanon that same year were lentils, chickpeas, sunflower, canary seeds, beans and cheese.
OPPORTUNITIES Opportunities for Canadian exporters to Lebanon include pulses, seed potatoes, meat, canola oil, finished products, canned/frozen food, dairy products (especially cheese), confectionery, and health and organic food.
With regard to the seed potatoes market, regulations including sanitary barriers, gross imported quantity and varieties to be imported are subject to yearly changes.
Generally, focus should be on price and nutritional properties, as the Lebanese consumer is quite health-oriented and reads labels carefully.
Further opportunities are opening up in the tourism/hospitality/catering sector, which shows consistent growth.
The hotel and restaurant sector is a dynamic market in Lebanon, and will be boosted by substantial growth for the next few years.
The ethnic restaurant (Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese Thaii) sector is also growing.

KEY PARTICIPANTS Canadian agri-food products face strong competition from Europe (especially companies from Italy, France, Germany and the Netherlands) due to Lebanon's long-standing ties with European countries, the strong representation of European companies in the Lebanese market and the relatively cheaper shipping costs for goods coming from Europe.
The United States has a considerable share, almost 48%, of the market and has managed to overcome the obstacles of long-distance transportation and decreasing the cost of shipment by exporting from Europe.
PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Lebanon is committed to reducing tariffs in line with its efforts to sign local, regional and global trade pacts.
Another measure adopted in 2001, was the reduction of tariff rates on imported goods in order to boost the economy and to comply with the process of Lebanon's accession to the World Trade Organization's conditions.
Tariffs on raw materials not available in Lebanon and semi-finished products not made in Lebanon have been abolished.
Tariffs vary between 50% and 70% on luxury items and up to 5% on items deemed necessary.
Imported food products requiring special licences include apples, olives, citrus fruit, pears, almonds, potato seeds and agricultural fertilizers.
Labelling on imported items should include net weight, production/expiry dates, ingredients and origin.
Labels in Arabic are not highly regarded as the Lebanese consider European and North American labels--in French or English--to be a guarantee of higher quality.
Substantial delays and administrative constraints in clearing imported products at customs/ports of entry are to be expected and quite frequent.
In order to decrease shipping costs, Canadian companies are advised to ship to the Middle East via Europe by either manufacturing their products in Europe or by re-exporting them.
It is preferable to have a local agent, representative or partner.
A small number of companies constitute the major food importers in the country and have their own distribution network.

Morocco Past Present & Future Report November 2005 Overview The Kingdom of Morocco is located in the northwest corner of Africa, and at its closest point, it is less than 15 kilometers away from Spain.
With a population of 31.1 million people, Morocco is a middle-income, moderate Arab and Muslim country, which is considered a developing country by international standards.
Morocco has an open economy and is steadily progressing towards greater levels of modernization and globalization.
Morocco is also currently striving to diversify its economy in order to lessen its reliance on the unstable agricultural sector.
Demand for more North American consumer-oriented products is expected to rise due to Morocco’s large and growing tourism industry as well as emerging large supermarkets and Americanized fast-food restaurants.
Currently, the vast majority of Canadian agri-foods entering Morocco are grains, bulks or cereals, especially wheat.
However, this market does present an opportunity for Canadian exports to diversify.
Canada – Morocco Relations Canada and Morocco’s friendly, diplomatic relationship which dates back to 1962 continues to grow.
This is due to many bilateral visits between countries, Canadian financial aid given to Morocco as well as the large Moroccan population living and attending university in Canada.
Currently, Moroccans make up our nation’s largest North African community.
Bilateral trade between Canada and Morocco has gradually increased over the past decade, although the countries’ exchanges remain rather modest and undiversified.
In attempt to become a more active trading partner, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada organized trade initiatives, which began in 1997 and included trade missions in various sectors such as environment, health and education.
In 2000, Canada led a multi-sector trade mission to the Maghreb which included visits to Morocco and Southern Europe.
This was the largest ever Canadian trade mission to North Africa.
Canada and Morocco relations have also flourished due to Canadian social development programs for Moroccans which have been ongoing since 1963.
For a more comprehensive overview of Canadian-Moroccan relations and trade arrangements please visit: dfait-maeci.gc.ca/middle_east/morocco_relations-en.asp
Top Canadian exports to Morocco are wheat and newsprint.
Top imports from Morocco are mandarins and petroleum oil preparations (including gasoline).
• Total Canada/Morocco agriculture trade was valued at $172.1 million in 2004.
Agriculture trade represents roughly 68% of all trade between the two countries.
In 2004, Canadian agri-food exports to Morocco totalled $121.1 million, increasing nearly 12% from 2003’s total of $108.1 million.
Top Canadian exports to Morocco in 2004 were durum wheat valued at nearly $102.2 million and accounting for 84.4% of agri-food exports, and wheat accounted for $11.2 million or 9.2% of total exports.
In 2004, bulk exports accounted for almost all of Canada’s agri-food exports to Morocco, with a value of $115.1 million.
In the same year, intermediate exports totalled only $5 million and consumer-oriented exports totalled less than $500,000.
Since food processing is Morocco’s primary processing industry, bulk food exports are expected to continually dominate Canadian agri-food exports to the country in the future.
Lentils and varieties of peas (split, green and yellow) are making strong headway into the Moroccan marketplace in the first half of 2005, respectively accounting for 10.5% and 2.6% of 2005’s export totals through October 2005.
Economy Morocco faces many challenges of a typical developing country; restraining government spending, reducing constraints on private activity and foreign trade, reducing high unemployment rates and achieving sustainable growth.
To improve conditions, the Moroccan government is currently working to liberalize its economy and foreign trade while keeping focused on its long-term challenges of improving education, living standards and job prospects for Morocco’s youth.
This has encouraged its government to work towards economic diversification, particularly towards manufacturing and services, which presently account for 35.8% and 43%, respectively, of Morocco’s GDP.
Morocco has a strong mineral sector, which is dominated by its phosphate reserves.
When attempting to export to Morocco it is important for exporters to focus mainly on its urban cities.
• The Moroccan government’s goal is to attract 10 million tourists to its country by 2010.
• The tourism industry is an important sector for Canadian exporters to consider as the growth of the industry is expected to boost demand for packaged food.
In the future, Canadian exporters should consider exporting high quality fish and seafood and dairy ingredients for the country’s expanding ice cream market.
• There are about 40 upscale hotels (5 star), 25 tourist villages and clubs, and over 139 hotels with 4-star rankings in Morocco.
These accommodations are concentrated mostly in Agadir, Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat, and Fes.
Morocco is a partner country of the European Trade Agreement.
Competing in this market can be made easier by making a contact in the country.
Exporters are encouraged to establish a linkage to Moroccan importers.
These importers are usually located in Casablanca and are described as being very progressive and marketing-oriented.
Exporters interested in selling consumer-ready goods can benefit from choosing a local importer with access to hotels and restaurants, as well as wholesale and retail markets.
Access Issues In an effort to ease the challenges of breaking into a new foreign market, Canadian exporters are encouraged to establish a contact base with local Moroccan importers.
Likewise, exporters should consult the Canadian Embassy in Morocco as a resource for exporting to this country.
The embassy works closely with the Moroccan government to facilitate trade transactions between countries http://www.dfaitmaeci.gc.ca/morocco/.
Morocco Country Report:
•
Import duties in Morocco are generally high and considered the main obstacle faced when exporting to this country.
This has a resulted in significantly reduced waiting times and a now well-organized customs service.
Business Travel Tips
• Moroccan business customs reflect a mix of Arab and Mediterranean influences, rather than African.
Breakfast meetings are rare, lunches tend to be late and long, and business meetings are most commonly held in offices rather than over meals.
Canadian exporters are encouraged to reconfirm appointments in advance and expect encountering delays.
It is also wise to schedule meetings recognizing that some could start, or run late.
Canadian exporters should be aware that Moroccan importers may not be familiar with products, as well as Canadian grades, standards and terminology.
Therefore pictures, brochures and samples may be helpful in business meetings.
Accept mint tea if it is offered as this is a symbol for hospitality in Morocco.
It is common for businesses to close for lunch from noon to 2:00 p.m., except during the period from June 15 to September 15 and during the month of Ramadan.
During Ramadan, many businesses remain open at mid-day but close earlier in the afternoon.
Morocco is a Muslim country.
Consumption of alcohol during the fasting month of Ramadan is prohibited for Muslims only.
Canadian exporters should exercise a high degree of caution in Morocco as Western interests, in particular, are at risk in this region.
Commercial and public areas known to be frequented by foreigners such as hotels, clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship, outdoor recreation events and tourist areas are more susceptible to risk.
Agriculture Sector & Policies Morocco is extremely dependant on its agricultural sector as it accounts for 15-20% of Morocco’s GDP (depending on the harvest) and employs about 40% of the country’s workforce.
Over 90% the country’s agriculture is rain-fed and thus this output is very unreliable.
Although this is a very important sector in Morocco, only 19% of the country’s land is cultivated.
Agriculture products include barley, wheat, citrus, wine, vegetables and livestock.
Morocco is a net exporter of fish as well as fruits and vegetables and imports many cereals, oilseeds and sugar.
Morocco has a rich fisheries sector which employs about 400,000 people (directly and indirectly).
The chief fishing centres in Morocco are Agadir, Safi, Essaouira, and Casablanca and the fish catch includes sardines, tuna, mackerel, anchovies, and shellfish.
Much of Morocco’s fish is processed—frozen or canned—for export to Europe, predominately.
Morocco’s food processing industry is one of its primary industries due its integration of the country’s rich and highly diversified local natural resources.

Tunisia Past Present & Future Report December 2005 Overview Tunisia is a predominantly Arab Muslim country which is located in Northern Africa and borders the Mediterranean Sea.
Despite its small geographic size, Tunisia leads Northern Africa in its economic diversity and has one of the highest standards of living on the continent.
Since 1987, the Tunisian government has greatly improved its economy and is now focused on moving towards greater international competitiveness.
Tunisia is a country with few natural resources, and is therefore highly reliant on foreign trade.
Currently, its imports and exports make up 80% of the country’s GDP.
Tunisia is a strong market prospect for Canadian exporters looking to tap into the North African food market; this is mainly due to the country’s growing middle-class, modernized food retail sector and thriving tourism sector.
Canada – Tunisia Relations Canada and Tunisia have a friendly bilateral relationship.
Tunisia is one of Canada’s longest-standing partners in Africa, with the earliest diplomatic Canadian-Tunisian contact dating back to 1957.
In 1966, Canada’s first embassy in the North African region of Maghreb opened in Tunisia’s capital, Tunis.
Canada-Tunisia relations are also strengthened due to Tunisia’s large Africanfrancophone base.
Tunisia is a founding member of La Francophonie and uses French as a delivery channel for its foreign policy.
Tunisia has long been a beneficiary of Canadian cooperation and aid in Africa.
Established in 1964, Canada’s cooperation program with Tunisia was one of the first in a Francophone African country.
Canada’s current development projects in Tunisia are CIDA’s Private Sector Development Fund and the Institutional Strengthening Program.
Currently, trade with Tunisia remains undeveloped although it has become increasingly diversified over the years.
The value of Canadian exports fluctuates considerably from year to year.

Tunisia Country Report:
Canada-Tunisia Bilateral Trade 2004 Tunisia Total Trade Exports (f.o.b) Imports (f.o.b) Trade balance Canada-Tunisia Trade Exports Imports Trade balance Canada-Tunisia Ag Trade Exports Imports Trade balance US$20.8 billion US $9.3 billion US $11.5 billion (US$2.2 billion) $56.3 million $32.4 million $23.9 million $8.5 million $16.5 million $10.4 million $6.1 million $4.3 million
In 2004, Canada’s top exports to Tunisia were wheat and electrical safety and traffic control equipment.
Main imports from Tunisia were olive oil and clothing.
Agricultural Trade Tunisia’s agricultural trade fluctuates annually due to its rain-fed products’ reliance on an unstable climate.
In drought years, the country relies heavily on imported agricultural commodities; while years showing favourable rainfall for domestic crops results in a decline in imported agricultural products.
In 2004, Canadian exporters saw a severe drop in agri-food exports to Tunisia, as the country witnessed favorable weather conditions and crop production.
Canadian agri-food exports to Tunisia totalled $16.5 million, decreasing by roughly 86% from 2003’s total of $74.7 million.
In contrast, Tunisia experienced a drought year in 2002 and Canadian agri-food exports reached $118.7 million.
Although agricultural trade with Tunisia rises and falls, agri-food exporters may benefit from Canada’s growing presence in the Tunisian food market.
Companies such as Rougement, Quebec’s Lassonde International Inc., Prevost Quebec’s Au Printemps Gourmet, Florenceville, McCain Produce and the Canadian Wheat Board are recently having success in the Tunisian food market.
Canada’s Top 4 Agricultural Exports to Tunisia (2004) Durum wheat Live turkeys Lentils Canary seed $9.9 million $337,000 $92,000 $42,000
Economy In 1987, the Tunisian government launched a privatisation and restructuring program to improve the country’s economy.
Over the years, this reform has built a more solid, diversified and competitive economy which is continually working to adapt to a new international environment.
Although the Tunisian government is still quite involved in the economy, its control over international affairs has lessoned with a turn towards privatization, simplification of the tax structure and a cautious approach to debt.
The government’s progressive social policies have also helped to raise the country’s living conditions.
Agriculture, textiles and clothing, mining, energy and tourism sectors are important contributors to the Tunisian economy.
In recent years, favorable rainfall, increased tourism rates and the removal of trade barriers with the European Union (EU) are all factors improving Tunisia’s economy.
In future years, Tunisia is looking towards broader privatization, increased foreign investment, improvements in government efficiency and reduction of the trade deficit.
• In 2004, Tunisia’s inflation increased to 3.6%.
From 1999-2003, the rate of inflation was steady, averaging 2.7% inflation during the period.
• In 2004, Tunisia had the highest per capita income in Northern Africa and ranked 6th on the African continent.
Forecast:
Agriculture Sector & Policies Agriculture is one of the most important sectors to Tunisia’s economy, accounting for roughly 13.7% of its GDP and one-fifth of its workforce.
The geography and climate of Tunisia is varied, containing a temperate mountainous region in the north, a Mediterranean maritime climate along the east coast, hot and dry plains in the centre and desert conditions in the south.
Of this land mass, roughly 18% is arable.
Tunisian agriculture, while important to the economy, lacks modern infrastructure and features an unpredictable climate which has negatively affected the country’s ability to be self-sufficient.
Tunisia also has few natural resources, which has increasingly put a large constraint on its agricultural sector.
Soil erosion, desertification, and rapid urbanization have depleted agriculture of arable land, labour and water and reduced its capacity for satisfying the growing food demand of the Tunisian population.
In an effort to combat these problems, the Tunisian government has implemented policies designed to conserve and better manage their resources.
This agreement especially increased the export of olive oil, double concentrate tomato paste and table grapes.
Next to olive oil, the fish and seafood industry represents the second major source of food export and is a principal activity in the agricultural sector.
This industry contributes roughly 8% of the agriculture value added.
Tunisia’s common fish catch includes tuna fish, shrimp, cuttlefish and squid, shellfish and mussels, octopus, sea bass and sea bream, sardines as well as anchovies.
Tunisia also has a food processing sector that is important to its economy.
Despite its underdeveloped status as compared to North American and European standards, food processing is Tunisia’s second largest industry next to its textile and clothing industry, accounting for 17% of industry activity.
There is also opportunity for Canadians to export to Tunisia’s expanding modernized retail food industry.
These retail outlets offer more variety for Tunisian consumers, including an array of imported food products.
Tunisia’s tourism industry also offers opportunity to Canadians wishing to tap into the country’s food market.
Every year 5 million tourists visit Tunisia and this industry is expanding, with 8,000 new beds being added to hotels each year.
Demand for imported food products is likely to grow, especially in less established tourism markets in the northwest coast and in the southern interior.
• Tunisians are moving towards more sophisticated consumption patterns due to the increase in modern food retailing.
• Tunisian consumers devote roughly US$5 billion, or 38%, of overall household spending, on food every year.
Common purchases include bread, pasta, semolina, olive oil and dairy products.
• Consumers are increasingly spending more on groceries.
• It is estimated that consumers living in Tunisia’s urban households spend nearly 65% more on food than consumers living in rural households.
Factors contributing to this are an increase of dual income households, increased urbanization and increased exposure to western lifestyles and products.
• About 80% of Tunisian families own houses and poverty numbers have been greatly decreased.
In 2004, Tunisia’s poverty rate was 7.6%, which is relatively low in comparison to Canada’s poverty rate.
• Tunisia has a young population with over 55% of Tunisians under the age of 25.
• 98% of the population is Muslim, and the official religion is Sunni Islam.
• Currently, there are roughly 220 modern food retail outlets: 2 hypermarkets, 120 supermarkets and 100 superettes (self-service food outlets with a selling area less than 500 sq. meters).
• Major players in the Tunisian modern food retailing industry are:
• Tourists represent an important consumer group to Canadian exporters, as 5 million visitors come to the country each year.
In recent years, these numbers have dropped due to political instability in the region and fallout from US terrorist attacks in 2001; however, tourism numbers are expected to recover.
• In 2005, tourism revenues were expected to surpass 2001’s record earning of $2.5 billion.
• To meet demands of international visitors, the Tunisian tourism industry requires a moderate amount of imported food.
Consequently, the sector represents opportunities for foreign suppliers of food and related services.
• Generally, the tourist industry is driven by visitors from four European countries:
Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.
These four nations contribute more than 75% of Tunisia’s tourist income.
Other visitors to Tunisia are from neighboring North African countries.
• In current terms, there are roughly 240 restaurants in Tunisia, catering to both domestic and international tourists.
• Over half of all restaurants in Tunisia are considered high-quality.
These types of restaurants are most likely to purchase foreign foods and should therefore be the primary target of Canadian companies selling to the restaurant industry.
• High-end hotels import spirits, wines and specialty cheeses either directly or via import companies.
In particular, hotels and restaurants are excellent targets for alcoholic beverage producers.
• Most hotels and restaurants in Tunisia source their food needs either through annual tenders or using the same distribution channels as households.
Competitors Canadian exporters face tough competition from European countries.
The EU is Tunisia’s major market: approximately 75-80% of Tunisia’s exports go to the EU, and more than 60% of imports originate from France, Italy, Germany and Spain.
France, especially, is a key export partner to Tunisia, as the countries have a strong history of francophone ties.
In addition to gaining closer bilateral trade relationships with Europe, Tunisia has pursued stronger relations with its North African neighbors.
In 2001, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia joined forces in The Great Arab Free Trade Zone ahead of the 2010 target for trade barriers to end in the Euro-Mediterranean area.
Over time, this free trade zone is expected to encompass 10 Arab nations.
The United States also has trade relationship with Tunisia through the United States-North African Economic Partnership, which encourages increased two-way trade between USA, Tunisia and other Maghreb states.
Although Canadian exporters face much competition from these countries, especially Europe, those Canadians wishing to transport food products to Tunisia can benefit from improved infrastructure which was put in place to obtain a free-trade status with the EU.
Tunisia has made changes to its Tunis-Carthage International Airport, and road and rail network improvements are increasing steadily.
Berthing space and port facilities are undergoing continuous upgrading.
Access Issues Canadian exporters must be prepared for bureaucratic hurdles when entering the Tunisian market due to the country’s traditionally high tariffs that protect the country’s domestic industries (particularly on consumer-oriented products).
Exporters of bulk and intermediate goods may also face "red tape".
In recent years, however, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged that high-tariffs be reduced as part of Tunisia’s "second-generation reforms".
The best way to access the Tunisian food retail market is through suitable local importers who are experienced in working with modern retail outlets.
Such importers are able to negotiate shelf space and promotional activities with supermarket chains.
Canadian exporters are encouraged to check the credentials of Tunisian importers.
Another approach may be to contact retailers directly, especially if exporters are interested in making large quantity shipments.
Small grocery stores Tunisia Country Report:
source their goods mostly from wholesalers and from certain importers who have their own distribution fleet to supply goods at the retail level.
Tunisia’s business environment is generally credible.
Long pants should always be worn by men, while women are advised to wear clothing that covers the majority of the body, especially shoulders and legs.
Establishing a personal relationship with prospective business partners is essential in doing business in Tunisia.
Maintaining this relationship through regular visits and other forms of personal contact are also recommended.
Because of the country’s emphasis on personal relationships, cold calling or sending direct mail to potential clients or customers is not recommended.
Tunisians perceive Canadian goods as of high-quality, but businessmen may be reluctant to pay substantial premiums, as price remains the most determining factor.
Therefore, Canadian exporters should be prepared for relatively demanding price negotiations.
Tunisia’s official language is Arabic, although French is widely spoken and serves as the common business language.
Many Tunisians are also beginning to speak English.
When invited into a Tunisian home for an Iftar meal, the meal marking the end of fast at sunset, it is common for guests to bring a small gift as a token of appreciation.
Businesses and offices in Tunis, the country’s capital, operate very limited hours during the month of August.

Table of Contents 1.
The world Halal food trade is estimated to reach US$150 billion annually.
Canada remains a small supplier of Halal products.
With approximately nine million Muslims, North America is the primary market for Canadian Halal products.
However, the increased demand for Halal products in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and North Africa represents an opportunity for Canadian companies to capture new markets, particularly in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Various statistical sources were consulted.
For Halal meat market information outside North America, country overviews and the contribution of agriculture to the economy are derived from the CIA World Fact Book.
The value of meat imported, along with Canada’s position against the top five suppliers for each country comes from Global Trade Atlas.
Specific import regulations on Halal meat are synthesized from country specific reports published from AAFC, International Trade Canada, and the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service.
The concept of Halal 2.1 Introduction This report provides information destined to assist Canadian agri-food companies compete with top Halal meat exporters and increase Canada's market share of the growing Halal food market.
The concept of Halal is described as well as the certification process.
The report also analyzes North American demand and market opportunities as well as general requirements by countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and North Africa.
A special focus is made on the market opportunities and official requirements for trade of Halal meat with the following countries:
Algeria Brunei Egypt Indonesia Iran Kuwait Malaysia Morocco Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates (UAE)
The opposite of Halal is Haram, which means unlawful.
The practice of Islam includes observing dietary laws that define foods that are Halal.
For Muslim consumers, meat products must be verified as Halal and must originate from certified slaughterhouses.
Many food products are clearly Halal or clearly Haram.
Others may be referred to as Mashbooh, which means doubtful.
Foods containing ingredients such as gelatine, enzymes, and emulsifiers are questionable (Mashbooh) because the origin of these ingredients is not known (IFANCA).
Market Opportunities in North America Islam is the second largest religion in the world and is also the fastest growing (www.eat-Halal.com/certification.shtml). As of 2003, there were approximately 1.4 billion Muslims in the world.
By the year 2025, 30% of the world’s population is expected to be Muslim (CIA World Fact Book, 2000).
North America has a Muslim population of approximately 9 million (IFANCA).
It is important for Canadian companies to understand the culture, tastes and preferences of Muslim consumers.
Consumers are expecting high-quality Halal food products at competitive prices.
3.1 Canada The Canadian domestic Halal meat market is estimated to be valued at $214 million.
The average annual household expenditure on Halal meat is $1,623.
The 2001 Canadian census outlined that there were approximately 579,640 Muslims in Canada, constituting 2% of Canada’s population.
The Canadian Muslim population is expected to double by the end of this decade (Statistics Canada).
Table 1 provides information on Canada’s Muslim population by province and territory, according to the latest Statistics Canada data in 2001.

The exact figure is difficult to ascertain because the United States census does not include questions regarding religious affiliation.
Certification process 4.1 Canadian Food Inspection Agency The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) aims to safeguard Canada’s food supply to ensure high-quality and safe standards.
4.2 General CFIA regulations for exports All foods produced in Canada for export must be inspected by the CFIA prior to export.
Only meat products prepared in CFIA registered establishments may be exported.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency provides a current listing of federally registered meat establishments.
Meat Inspection Regulations, 1990 Section on Meat Products for Exports 121.
No operator shall identify as edible any meat product intended for export unless the meat product meets the requirements of the importing country and is packaged and labelled in accordance with section 122.
(1) Subject to subsection (2), every operator shall package and label a meat product intended for export in accordance with the requirements of the importing country or, where no such requirements exist, shall package and label the meat product as required by Part III.
(2) Every operator shall ensure that a meat product that is produced for export as an edible meat product and does not meet the requirements of these Regulations for a meat product intended for sale, use or consumption as an edible meat product in Canada is, in addition to being packaged and labelled in accordance with all other requirements of these Regulations, labelled as being for export.
All export shipments of meat products (except those specifically exempted in the Meat Inspection Regulations) must be accompanied by a "Certificate of Inspection Covering Meat Products" authorized by CFIA.
In addition, only an official veterinarian may sign certificates for exports of meat products.
Standard trade documentation, including bills of lading and attestations by the government and/or embassy of the importing country must be present.
The CFIA is not involved in Halal certification.
Canadian companies interested in obtaining Halal certification should contact one of the certification bodies listed in Appendix 2 for specific regulations.
Submit an application form for Halal certification and supervision.
An inspector must inspect the facility to verify that it complies with Halal standards, including process, products, materials, and sanitation procedures.
Once the inspection report is complete, it is submitted to the Halal Slaughter Certification Committee (SCC) along with any recommendations.
Registration of slaughter facility
Upon approval of the plant by the SCC, the registrant will receive an official letter, specifying the terms and conditions of the registration.
A supervisor will be assigned to perform the necessary procedures in the plant.
A supervision fee is usually dependent upon the work entailed.
Certification fee
The certification fee is established after the plant is registered and accounts for details such as the number of plants involved, the complexity of the product line, the product volume and the projected consultation requirements throughout the year.
Issuance of certificates and signing of agreement
Every certifying body has a registered symbol for labels of Halal products.
Certificates are issued for each batch of Halal products.
Market Opportunities outside North America and Specific Requirements by Country In this section, an overview of the country is given while the domestic agricultural production is highlighted.
Canada’s presence is quite small in the other countries.
Many countries have special requirements, which are either in addition to, or distinct from, Canadian requirements.
Individual countries outline regulations specific to their needs.
However, there are common requirements across markets worth noting:
Halal exportcertified establishments must also ensure their meat products originate from a source approved by the importing country.
The Islamic organization providing the certification must be approved by the importing country.
The presence of pork and/or alcohol must be strictly and clearly labelled in some countries.
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which stipulates that all products must arrive with at least half of their shelf life remaining.
General documents: commercial invoice, bill of lading, certificate of origin, Halal certificate, and veterinary health certificate for meat products are examples of common documents required in each country.
5.1 Algeria (Capital city:
Algiers) Algeria is situated in Northern Africa and borders Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Western Sahara and the coast of the Mediterranean sea and has a population of nearly 33 million.

According to Euromonitor, meat accounts for nearly 20% of consumer expenditure on food in Algeria.
The majority, in fact, 92% of meat imported by Algeria is bovine meat.
Mutton and goat meat holds the next highest share of all meat imported at 6%.
Brazil provided nearly half of this volume, followed by Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia.
Algeria did not import meat from Canada in 2005, but it did import $US 42,458 worth of bovine meat in 2004 from Canada (GTI).
There must be an agreement on the authorization of imports between the food inspection agency of the exporting country and the Direction of Veterinary Health of the Ministry of Agriculture in Algeria prior to imports.
In recent years, Algeria has experienced market liberalization and reductions in customs duties.
French is the predominant business language, giving an advantage to importers capable in French.
Most importers are in large cities and import through main active ports.
Export certificate for breeding cattle has been agreed upon with Canada.
Halal certification is required for meat products entering Algeria.
Customs clearance requires four to five days.
The importer has 21 days to clear merchandise through customs, after which it is transferred to storage.
Goods with a durable life within one year must have a durable life of at least half of their shelf life on the inspection date.
Products with a durable life of more than one year must have a durable life of at least 30% of their shelf life on the date of inspection.
Proper labelling requires Arabic, the product’s common name, all ingredients, the specific quantity, contact information, and manufacture and expiry dates.
The customs tariff comprises three rates: 5%, 15% and 30%.
Some specific items are subject to a VAT ranging between 7 and 17%.
A domestic consumption tax (TIC) also applies to meat products.
Brunei (Capital city:
Bandar Seri Begawan) Brunei is a small country that lies on the northwest coast of Borneo.
Per capita income is high for the population of roughly 380,000.
Malay is the official language while English and Chinese are used as well.
The Islamic faith is the official religion of Brunei and 67% of people are Muslim.
Brunei produces poultry, eggs, and water buffalo.
Half of Brunei’s meat imports in 2003 was bovine meat.
Importers of meat must apply for a Halal Import Permit from the Controller of Customs under the Board for issuing Halal Import Permits.
Whenever any Halal meat is imported, authorized officers from the Ministry of Health and the Agriculture Department will examine it and certify it as fit for human consumption.
The Inspection Committee shall ensure that meat must only be imported from countries where animals are free from dangerous and contagious diseases and where only local animals are slaughtered.
The inclusion of alcohol in food products must be labelled in capital bold-faced lettering of non-serif character greater than six points.
Cairo) Egypt occupies the northeast corner of Africa, bordering Libya in the west, Sudan in the south, the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and the Red Sea and Israel in the east.
The majority of the population of nearly 79 million is concentrated near the fertile Nile valley.
Approximately 90% of the population is Muslim.
Cattle, water buffalo, sheep and goats are among Egypt’s agricultural products.
Over 32% of the labour force is involved in agriculture, which comprises 16% of the overall GDP.
For consumers in Egypt, around 23% of food spending is on meat.
According to 2003 figures, consumption of red meat, poultry, and fish reached 4.6, 7.4, and 18.6 kilograms per capita, respectively (Euromonitor).
In 2004, Egypt imported $US 183,273,907 worth in meat.

These zones are subject to minimal regulation.
Individual agents must be of Egyptian nationality and residents of Egypt for at least five years.
Canadian Access (as of March 5, 2006):
Currently bovine meat products are limited to chilled or frozen boneless beef, including beef livers, kidneys and hearts.
Poultry imports are not permitted.
This certificate must accompany products labelled Halal.
The Egyptian Embassy in Canada must authenticate the certificate.
Halal labelling is a responsibility of the exporter.
General labelling must be in Arabic and English and include storage temperatures on all meat products, production and expiration dates, and metric net weight.
All products must be shipped direct from the country of origin.
Jakarta) Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state, comprising 17,508 islands and stretching between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.
Indonesia is home to the world’s largest Muslim population.
Given that 88% of the total population of 245 million people belong to the Islamic faith, Indonesia offers positive opportunities for Halal food exports.
According to Euromonitor, Indonesians allocate 8.4% of their consumer food expenditure to meat.
In Indonesia, the number of chicken farms is greater than the number of red meat farms.
Between 1998 and 2003, poultry consumption soared by 34% from 3.04 to 4.07 kg per capita.
Overall, prices of red meat fluctuate significantly depending on demand, supply, imports, and holidays.
Processed foods are popular, especially frozen items.
Indonesians typically stockpile frozen poultry and meat before major holidays and anticipated price jumps.
A secondary reason for growing acceptance of frozen foods is that refrigerators have become more affordable to many people.
Nearly 47% of the country’s labour force is employed in agriculture, a sector that is responsible for 15% of the country’s total GDP.
In 2003, three quarters of Indonesia’s meat imports were bovine meat.
The next leading type of meat imported was pig meat, which stood for 17% of all imports.
Poultry and mutton and goat meat split the remainder (FAO).
Singapore and China were also notable import partners.
For imported products, the registration process is completed by the Indonesian importers before goods are shipped to Indonesia.
Current Import Regulations:
Customs clearance can be finished in two days given complete documentation.
However, poultry may not always require Halal certification.
Exporters are advised to verify this with their importer before shipping.
Meat imported into Indonesia is legally required to be inspected and certified as Halal.
Labels must use the Indonesian language and Arabic numerals.
Labels include as a minimum the product name, ingredients, net weight in metric units, the importer’s name and address, expiry date, and whether the product is Halal.
Products derived from swine must be labelled by "MENGANDUNG BABI" (contains pork) in red "universe medium corps 12" font.
The writing must be enclosed in a red rectangle with a drawing of a pig.
The State Livestock Affairs Logistics (SLAL) and the Government Trading Corporation (GTC) are the two main importers of meat in Iran, as the private sector is not allowed to import.
A notable feature of Iran’s trade policies is how it is subject to US economic sanctions and export controls.
Approximately 90% of all meat that Iran imports is bovine meat.
Poultry completes the rest of Iran’s meat imports (FAO).
In 2003, Iran imported $US 60,711,964 worth in meat, of which over half originated from Ireland, and 30% came from Brazil.
The exporting establishment has the responsibility to conform to the importing country’s standards.
All imports must be registered with the Ministry of Commerce in order to obtain a general import licence.
5.6 Kuwait (Capital city:

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Saudi Arabia December 2006
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
Although every effort has been made to ensure that the information is correct, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada assumes no responsibility for its accuracy, reliability, or for any decisions arising from the information contained herein.

Saudi Arabia Country Report:
Saudi Arabia Past Present & Future Report December 2006 Overview Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter, with by far the greatest proven reserves of crude oil.
Based on current output, there are sufficient reserves for almost 90 years of extraction.
This oil wealth has transformed the country’s economy, although politically and socially Saudi Arabia remains highly conservative.
Canada-Saudi Arabia Relations Canadian - Saudi relations are built on a strong bilateral trade relationship, with trade increasing significantly since 2002.
While imports from Saudi Arabia dominate trade, Canada’s exports have seen very positive increases.
Exports reached a high in 2004, fell slightly in 2005, but maintained a level well above pre-2002 totals.
Canada’s imports are dominated by oil, with most trade value increases with Saudi Arabia a result of recent record oil prices.
• The value of Canada's two-way trade with Saudi Arabia was approximately $1.7 billion in 2005.
Canadian exports to the Kingdom in 2005 totalled $439 million a significant decrease of almost $150 million from 2004.
Despite the decrease, Saudi Arabia continues to be one of Canada's largest merchandise export markets in the Middle East and North Africa.
Canada’s largest export to Saudi Arabia in 2005 was barley followed by paper products, vehicles and lumber.
Canada's merchandise imports from Saudi Arabia in 2005 were valued at $1.7 billion and consisted mainly of crude oil, organic chemicals, and refined petroleum products.
Canada-Saudi Arabia Bilateral Trade Saudi Arabia Total Trade Exports Imports Trade balance $165 billion $45 billion $120 billion
Canada-Saudi Arabia Trade $439 million Exports Imports Trade balance $1.7 billion ($1.2 billion)
Canada-Saudi Arabia Ag Trade $77.66 million Exports Imports Trade balance $76.61 million
suppliers are increasingly important players in the Saudi market.
There has been success, particularly in dairy production, but the country is currently nowhere near self sufficient agricultural production.
Saudi Arabia's agri-food imports in 2004 were estimated to be $8 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2003.
Barley alone represents 10% of total agricultural imports.
Canada is forecast to export 500,000 tonnes to Saudi Arabia.
The country’s top suppliers of agricultural products include; Ukraine, Syria, Brazil, India and the United States.
Overview of Agricultural Trade Between Canada and Saudi Arabia
Canada’s exports were valued at $77.6 million or roughly 98% of total Canada-Saudi Arabia agricultural trade in 2005.
Despite decreases in barely exports, 2005 witnessed significant increases in a number of product categories.
For instance, cheese and lentil exports both grew by over $1 million.
Even more impressive was the growth in exports of ground nuts (+$2.2 million) and ice cream (+$6 million).
Canada’s exports are dominated by bulk commodities, namely barley, and comprise 98% of Canada’s total bulk exports.
Exports of consumer products have been increasing steadily since 2003.
Through to September of 2006, exports of consumer goods have already exceeded 2005 totals.
Canada imported $1.05 million worth of agricultural goods from Saudi Arabia in 2005.
Imports from Saudi Arabia have been in a slow decline since 2003, usually falling $100,000 annually.
• Sectors that have been identified as potential targets for privatisation include electric power, mining, aviation, and telecommunications.
Saudi Arabia Country Report:
Non-Saudi nationals and expatriates dominate the Saudi workforce.
This policy has restricted the entry of foreign workers into certain job categories and led to a quota system that requires all companies to employ a percentage of Saudis in their operations.
Forecast While the economic foundation as a major oil exporter looks secure and economic diversification has proven beneficial to the economy, there is little prospect of significant political and economic reform in the near future.
Reforms must be balanced with the political aspirations of senior members of the ruling family and the wishes of the powerful clerical establishment, and it is expected that any future reforms will be cautious and piecemeal.
Plans to introduce an elected component to the national Consultative Council appear to be on hold.
Consumer Market Overview Saudi Arabia is a diverse and highly urbanised society.
While the country remains difficult to access and the food market difficult to penetrate, the country has become increasingly exposed to and influenced by Western trends.
Saudi Arabia is the largest market for high-valued foodstuffs in the Middle East/North African region.
• Saudi Arabia's population is roughly 24 million, of which almost 25% are nonnationals/expatriates.
The Kingdom's population is expected to almost double within 20 years to more than 40 million.
Nearly 70% of the population is under the age of 30, with 40% of the population born after 1990-91.
Riyadh is the capital city and the seat of government.
Other major population centres include Jeddah, on the west coast, and the twin cities of Dammam/AlKhobar on the east coast.
Most expatriates are from South Asia (i.e. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, the Philippines, and East Africa.
There are roughly 100,000 American and British professionals residing in Saudi Arabia.
Expatriates make up a majority of the Saudi workforce.
In addition to simple staple purchases, supermarket shopping is considered a type of entertainment to Saudi families.
Large play areas for children, boutiques, specialty shops, and fast food restaurants have been incorporated into the grocery buying experience.
There are roughly 300 supermarkets in Saudi Arabia and a significant increase in this number is expected, due to the increasing popularity of Western style shopping formats.
Despite a Western influence to supermarket formats, all supermarket chains in the Kingdom are wholly-owned by Saudi companies.
However, Western (foreign) managers are common.
Until recently, supermarket chains were dependent on local importers for sourcing, merchandising, and inventory control.
However, the benefits of direct importing have not been lost on the larger, high volume chains where this method is increasing in popularity.
Importers are constantly searching for new products, and often request support from suppliers for promotion.
The increasingly positive attitude of Saudis to mass media advertisements means that advertising is considered a necessity to draw Saudi consumers.
Despite the perceived wealth of the population, Saudis can be a price conscious consumer market.
For instance, two-for-one deals have proven to be effective marketing ploys in large supermarkets.
Private labels are becoming commonplace in Saudi Arabia.
It is not uncommon for foreign products to be given Arab sounding names to appeal to local consumers.
Some large Saudi importers are willing to test-market a new food product under the condition that if it succeeds, the product will be labelled under their own private brand.
The limited ability of Saudi women to drive cars has maintained the popularity of local/corner stores (bakalahs).
These stores are present in every neighbourhood and are especially important in the housing compounds of expatriates.
Despite the proliferation of supermarkets, these corner or local stores continue to thrive and have greatly expanded their product base.
Saudi consumers are selective, but enjoy new food products and look for the best deal.
They are attentive to quality, nutritional value, price, and packaging.
International fast food chains continue to expand and are found in major urban areas.
Many of the international fast food chains and select local outlets have chosen to import a significant share of their required ingredients.
A number of international fast food chains and food and beverage companies are actively involved in the Saudi Arabian market.
Competitors Key competitors to products that Canada currently produces are Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
However, long-term relationships that have developed between Saudi Arabia and companies from these nations have been strained by current geo-political and economic circumstances, leading Saudi businesspeople to begin actively seeking alternatives to traditional suppliers.
This shift could present a number of significant opportunities for Canadian exporters, as Canadian products are perceived as extremely competitive, from both a quality and price standpoint.
Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s agricultural imports are dominated by five key markets (Ukraine, Syria, Brazil, India and the U.S.) and five key products (barley, sheep & goats, frozen chicken, rice and cigarettes).
American products are still a large player in the Saudi food market, but have suffered from a recent boycott.
American products are suffering due to consumer perceptions of political situations, and while they have recovered from the most recent boycott, a growing number of consumers and local buyers are seeking nonAmerican products.
In the search for more non-traditional markets, Saudi Arabia has been very active in improving regional relations in the hopes of strengthening trade relations with its neighbours.
Saudi Arabia is a member of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), which was established in 1981 to promote prosperity and security among organisation members.
Member states also include the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain.
The GCC has approved duty exemptions covering the import of more than 400 items, including basic foodstuffs.
The Council has also taken a number of steps to promote intra-GCC trade, including the implementation of a Customs Union which has harmonised the customs tariff at 5% of an item's value.
The following is a list of some other consumer ready food products with high export potential:
Additional
• Variety of food ingredients to meet the growing demand of the expanding processing sector.
Access Issues Overview
• Foodstuffs imported freely with very limited non-tariff barriers.
Imports of alcoholic beverages, live swine, pork, and food ingredients or additives which contain pork products (including pork fat and gelatine) are banned.
Meat and poultry shipments must be accompanied by a "Halal" slaughter certificate.
Poultry and livestock meat shipments must show that they are from animals that were not fed animal protein ruminants and were not treated with any growth hormones.
Transhipment of livestock meat through Europe and other countries affected by Bovine Spongiform Encephalopothy (BSE) and Foot and Mouth Disease are banned.
• Getting a visa to visit the country can be difficult.
There are different tax systems for Saudis and non-Saudis.
There is no value-added tax.
Sixteen areas of commercial activity have restrictions on foreign investment.
The willingness of Saudi consumers to support boycotts of Western products is a potential roadblock for exporters during periods of unrest in the Middle East.
Business Travel Tips
• Successful business relationships are very personal, develop over time and maintain a positive air at all times.
Carefully consider offers of hospitality; they are important relationship builders, but reciprocation is expected.
According to customs, social and business contacts are for men only.
Be cognizant of local prayer times.
Businesses will typically close for short periods a number of times a day to allow for prayer.
Visiting during Ramadan is not recommended.
Business will be difficult to conduct and visitors may find it very difficult to adapt their normal behaviour to the strict guidelines of the holy month.
These issues include restrictions on where, when and what to eat and drink during the Holy month.
Western visitors are common and only offensive behaviour or dress will be noticed.
However, the security of Western travelers and expatriates has become an issue recently and necessary precautions should be taken.
The Saudi government has set the task of achieving near self-sufficiency in food, a daunting challenge as Saudi Arabia is one of the world's most arid countries.
Domestic agricultural growth depends on scarce water resources; therefore, recent development plans have sought to diversify products to crops grown with equipment using less water.
The government has made key decisions to limit mass production of products like barley, in order to preserve the country’s limited water resources.
The domestic sector has benefited greatly from neighbouring markets, as Saudi Arabia’s involvement in a regional trade group has given easy access to many of its products.
• Saudi Arabia is home to the largest integrated herd of dairy livestock in the world, and has become self-sufficient in the production of eggs and poultry, cereals, and select fruits and vegetables.
In 2000/01, the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank lent US$555 million to the agriculture sector which has greatly benefited in its expansion.
Imports of key inputs for the sector will continue to grow along with sector development (i.e. barley imports).

Market Information Middle East and North Africa TRENDS... food in the UAE 2007
Prepared by Agri-Food Program Section Consulate of Canada Dubai, UAE
Table of Contents INTRODUCTION TRADE/MARKET ACCESS PORK BEEF FISH HALAL PRODUCTS ORGANICS AND OTHER HEALTHFUL MATTERS RETAIL HRI/FOODSERVICE INVESTMENT TREND-BITS...random food for thought!
INTRODUCTION Without a doubt, something in the government's "vision" , as enunciated by the Minister, is clearly working.
For a change, from the countless vision statements we have had to digest over many years, whether corporate or governmental from all parts of the world (including back home), we think the actual visionary piece is, in this case, the driving element of the economic development success equation that is the UAE's.
In 2005, nominal growth was over 26% (real at 8.5%), making this economy the 37th largest globally, and 4th in terms of per capita GDP (e.g., the U.S. is 7th, and Canada 16th).
As I listened to a business show on a Dubai radio station one evening, the commentators seemed a tad apoplectic as a result of that day's business headlines:
"Dubai is second worldwide in building offices" ; and "Dubai airport records world's second best growth" . The reporters queried each other endlessly as to whether such runner-up rankings suggested that Dubai was losing its competitive "edge" . As one might expect when cheering for the home-team, their conclusions would have done any Chambre of Commerce proud...after all Moscow, ranked first in office construction, has roughly ten-times the population base, and at current rates of passenger traffic growth, Dubai airport will overtake the venerable Heathrow by 2011.
We found this little exchange amusing, as one gazes out most any window at a sea of construction cranes hanging over the Dubai landscape.
But what it quickly makes apparent is the seriousness taken here at all levels in having the world's biggest storage facility, richest horse-race purse, tallest building, first Tiger Wood's designed golf course, iconic architecture, or whatever.
In short, no effort is spared in undertaking projects with the objective of a numero uno ranking in the world.
And the bloodline of ever-growing commercial diversification, in its many dimensions and away from petroleum-dependency, is what continues pumping life into the superlatives that frame this economy.
The drive to be first in the world manifests itself in some strange ways.
But again, what would be the point in giving away such "vital" competitive information prematurely to the likes of Singapore, Hong Kong, or even other Gulf states, all with their own designs on entering "the tallest-biggest-first" sweeps!
To paraphrase a recent comment offered by Stephen Poloz, Chief Economist, Export Development Canada: the bottom line is that despite all the superlatives being used to describe Dubai (and by extension, the Emirates as a whole), it still has the capacity to surprise.
For the Arab region as a whole, the Council of the Arab Common Market released its forecast in 2006 of the expected gap between demand and what is available in food product supplies.
By 2010, the gap will widen to 61 million tonnes (t), including the need for 28 million t of flour, 7 million t of sugar, 5 million t of edible oils, 15 million t of meat, and 7 million t of milk and dairy products.
The gap will result from both increased population growth and rising per capita income in the region...and Dubai remains well-positioned both with the needed infrastructure and expertise to service the imports (and re-exporting) needed to meet this demand.
So back to Sheikha Lubna...is there no fly in the ointment, no caveat which might benefit from a little more "governmental" attention...is it all easy gravy for those choosing to do business here.
Well not exactly.
This is not a market without its specific challenges.
It is worth noting, for example, that the World Bank's most recent (Fall 2006) global ranking on the ease of doing business in 175 countries ranked the UAE a lowly 77th.
Indeed, the UAE placed only 5th among 17 countries, in the Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region.
The ranking is based on 10 factors used to assess the regulatory environment and its conduciveness to doing business.
To provide you with an idea of the range, Singapore ranked first, the U.S. and Canada were 3rd and 4th respectively, China 93rd and India at 134.
And agri-food exports to this market are not exempt from the challenges presented in this regard.
Whether it involves trying to get additional Canada-based halal certifiers approved, or promoting Canadian wines, or the legal need to secure an Emirati partner (now being changed), or the challenging "shelf-life" dating requirements, etc., it is not a market for the impatient...and building personal relationships over time is fundamental to any meaningful success.
So does all of this mean anything when it comes to Canadian agri-food exporters' potential interests in this market?
We would suggest yes, and as an astute friend once taught me..."always give them three things" : 1.
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members (i.e., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE) are generally booming along for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are oil revenues.
One key strategic principle which underlies and promotes Dubai's growth is that it is designed to be a distribution hub within the region.
With respect to agriculture and food products this focus has been and remains an ever growing reality, with redistribution occurring not only within the Gulf and Middle East, but reaching further-flung markets such as Iran, Iraq, Russia, India and Pakistan to name but a few.
The considerable investment in state-of-the-art infrastructure to achieve this end has occurred and continues to be upgraded.
In short, Dubai (and the UAE) is far more than solely an export destination in its own right.
Canadian agri-food exports to the UAE now have a "momentum" to be capitalized on.
At time of writing, our export levels by the end of November 2006 were up an impressive 330% over our total exports for 2005.
The range of opportunities run across the board from 5-star hotels, to a more-than-doubling of cruise ship tourist visits expected next year, to the huge expat worker camps, continued growth the well-heeled westpat "immigration" whether as professionals or retirees...in short, they all gotta eat!
This first issue of TRENDS...food in the UAE will explore some of the many trade development and trade policy considerations at play which, from our perspective, currently shape the UAE market.
Hopefully, the reader will find some of the matters touched upon to be of direct interest, or more likely, will be encouraged to think laterally with respect to how the issues and opportunities identified might apply to his/her products or ideas, even though not directly treated herein.
Much of the statistical information contained in TRENDS has been gathered from secondary sources.
All views expressed are those of the authors alone, and are not to be confused with Government of Canada policy on any given matter.
TRADE/MARKET ACCESS This newsletter is largely oriented to market trends and trade development opportunities.
However, we assume that an overview of the trade policy issues and initiatives, which provide some context for this market, would be useful to those interested in pursuing its many opportunities.
The statistics bear it out, the UAE's foreign trade has made impressive strides in recent years.
Commodity exports are expected to top C$170 billion, growing by 21% from 2005, with oil's share forming 40% of these exports.
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) - for an essentially small country, the UAE is involved in an aggressive array of trade negotiations both bilaterally and as a member of the GCC.
A number of these negotiations are with suppliers that compete directly with Canada.
Even though at time of writing, the UAE had yet to sign a formal FTA with any of its trade partners either bilaterally or through the GCC, a number agreements border on reaching a conclusion.
On the bilateral front, negotiations between the UAE and the U.S. continue.
Although these talks appeared to be moving relatively quickly, they reached a hiatus around March (2006).
A few specific challenges not related to the agriculture, fish or food sectors, slowed things down (i.e., telecommunications and inward investment for the UAE, and a U.S. preoccupation with the Emirates' labour policies and employment conditions).
And although both sides soft-pedal the issue, the Dubai Ports (DP) World fiasco also slowly seeped into the two countries' commercial relationship, and did little to enhance the negotiating mood.
With U.S. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) expiring at the beginning of July 2007, and the results of the 2006 mid-term elections having re-shaped Congress, one would further assume that there would be little appetite in the U.S. Administration to expend the considerable political capital necessary (if even possible) to now push various potential trade agreements through the House and Senate.
In practical terms, a deal with the UAE would have to be wrapped-up by late March, if there is to be any real hope of getting it through Congress before the end of June, when TPA expires.
UAE bilateral negotiations were also underway with Australia and Singapore, but have now been transferred to the GCC level.
As with the U.S., we assume that any eventual GCC deal with Australia will include the agricultural sector, essentially for the same reasons as it would with the U.S. In short, it's a win-win given the UAE's (and Gulf generally) food deficit situation, and U.S./Australia's strong agri-food export orientation.
However, it will be interesting to see how the Emirates attempt to protect some of their smaller, less efficient food industries (e.g., dairy products), given that any eventual FTAs, with any trade partner having an agri-food export interest, would force the UAE to eliminate its restrictive protection measures (most notably the use of production/shelf-life dating in this regard).
On the multilateral front, as a member of the GCC, the UAE also finds itself involved in a raft of multilateral negotiations.
In addition to Singapore and Australia, these are underway with the EU, China, Pakistan and India.
The EU negotiations started in 1990, and have proceeded in various fits-and-starts since initiation.
The EU is the GCC's largest trading partner, and the GCC is the fifth largest market for EU products.
Senior level Emirati political pressure (e.g., most recently the publicised efforts of Sheikha Lubna, the highly regarded Minister of Economy) urging the EU to speed up GCC free trade talks, continues to mount.
As well, negotiations with China and India got underway in 2004 and 2005 respectively.
More recently, Singapore and the GCC announced that they would begin FTA talks early in 2007.
Other countries including Japan, Turkey, New Zealand, Switzerland/EFTA (in parallel with the EU's negotiations), Pakistan, Korea, Thailand, Jordan and potentially Azerbaijan, have all now expressed interest in or intent to begin FTA negotiations on a GCC basis.
And as a final aside, we would note that within the GCC, the U.S. has concluded bilateral FTAs with Oman, Bahrain, and more widely within the region with Jordan, Morocco and Israel.
Although all were not initiated by President Bush, each agreement is a supportive plank in his declared goal of establishing a Middle Eastern Free Trade Area (MEFTA).
However as noted above, the reconstituted November 2006 Congress will likely impede furtherance of this objective.
The bilaterals with Oman and Bahrain created considerable consternation within the GCC, notably with Saudi Arabia...the regional heavyweight, arguing that the FTAs violate the GCC customs union.
This perceived undermining of GCC solidarity may also play in to the UAE's current negotiations with the U.S. Trade Policies - the UAE has been a Contracting Party to the GATT since 1994, and subsequently a Member of the WTO in 1996.
It grants at least MFN tariff treatment to all its trade partners, except Israel, and saw the customs union component of the GCC (i.e., a common tariff for all 6 members) take effect in 2003.
The UAE has never been involved in any trade litigation under the WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism.
The WTO published its first Trade Policy Review for the UAE in 2006.
The report provides a comprehensive review of all UAE domestic policies that could affect trade, as well as sector policy profiles including agriculture and related activities.
This overview is freely available through the WTO's website at http://docsonline.wto.org/gen_home.asp (see document WT/TPR/S/162, March 20, 2006).
PORK As a Muslim country, one is of course excused to assume a very limited (if any!) market in the UAE for pork products.
The market is stratified into several segments: retail outlets drawing on the resident expat community which, in turn, represents 80% of the population base; tourist/business visitors which (along with healthy portion of the resident expat community) fuel a vibrant and growing hotel and restaurant sector; and other market outlets which also continue to grow (e.g., ship chandlers, catering, U.S. military installations in the region, etc.). In our Fall visits to key UAE importers with Canada Pork International, a number of salient observations arose.
At retail, the bulk of frozen product is purchased by Filipinos, who tend to be largely employed in the service industries.
Price is the dominant factor in sourcing product for this group.
There are only 3 retailers licensed to sell pork to the public (i.e., Spinneys, T. Choithrams & Sons Ltd., and Lal's)...notably, Carrefour does not hold a licence.
The western expat sub-community (westpat), particularly the growing number of European professionals rotating through, as well as retirees settling in the UAE, suggests continuing growth in demand at the retail level for chilled cuts and processed pork products.
This could represent an initially modest opportunity for Canadian suppliers.
However, when coupled with an explosion in further hotel capacity expected over the next 10 years (i.e., plenty more tourists and additional demand for high-end "real" pork and bacon products), this could be coupled with foodservice and catering sector demand and build into a more substantive opportunity for those suppliers willing to invest the time needed to build the business relationships fundamental to this market.
Indeed, Dubai will have some 41,500 hotel rooms by the end of 2006, and experts are projecting 86,600 rooms by 2016.
Although prescribed mandatory retail shelf-lives can pose a challenge in servicing the retail sector (i.e., especially when it comes to chilled product), air cargo transportation links from Canada are continuously improving, and should be able to minimize the effects of this limitation.
As well, the limited time-window prescribed under UAE regulations for any food products "dating" requirement (i.e., "produced on..." and "expiry on..." ), does not apply to the foodservice sector.
BEEF So how is Canada's competition doing in the UAE market?
There are clearly a number of reasons undermining Canada's beef presence in retail coolers/freezers and on restaurant menus.
However, with the UAE's December 2005 acceptance of beef from Canadian animals (i.e., under thirty months of age), and continued efforts to have additional Canadian halal certifiers approved, we hopefully look forward to Canadian beef in this market over the medium term.
This market wants beef.
For example, Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) announced (Fall 2006) that the demand and consumption of Australian beef per month has nearly doubled in the UAE.
A year ago, about 10-12 tonnes of Aussie beef were consumed per month, but the amount has now shot up to about 20 tonnes per month, in a market that consumes a total of some 100 tonnes per month.
The MLA argues that it is their extensive investment in and commitment to offering a top quality product which has gone a long way in making their beef the ingredient of choice for chefs and patrons alike in most higher-end dining and steakhouse establishments.
This commitment has also been bolstered by a number of other factors at play in the UAE market itself: high disposable incomes, liberal trade policies, zero or low import duties, and of course, a very limited local production of meat.
The general prosperity enjoyed in the market, as well as the growing numbers of working women, has meant eating-out is a fast growing trend.
As well, another important and visible reason (according to the MLA) is the continuing huge construction boom with a host of international hotel chains all offering fine dining experiences, causing the demand for quality beef to grow exponentially.
In the words of one Australian exporter whose volumes to this part of the world have doubled in two years "...who would have said two years back that we would be serving Wagyu in most parts of the Middle East today."
The anticipated growth in hotel accommodation over the next number of years is noted in several places in this report, and underlies a lot of the continued growth expected in the UAE's foodservice industry.
Dubai for example, aims to attract 6.8 million tourists in 2007, with an objective of reaching 10 million by 2010.
FISH There's no shortage of demand for fish in the Emirates, from the needs of the growing numbers of 5-star hotel-restaurants aiming to satisfy the palates of their discriminating clienteles, to fresh (and in some cases live) fish markets catering to nationals and resident expats, to extensive fresh fish counters in all the major retail chains.
In terms of a domestic industry, fishing in the UAE is carried out mainly at an artisanal level.
On the supply side of fresh fish, the country is considered self-sufficient, with a catch of around 115,000 tonnes (1998), which includes pelagics, demersals and migratory species at given times of the year.
Modern large fishing boats are prohibited in coastal waters in order to preserve the coastal environment, as well as fishermen's interests.
Per capita fish consumption of UAE nationals is estimated at 33 kg.
This is high relative to other Arab countries and the world as a whole (FAO world estimate of 16.5 kg in 2003).
The full gamut of frozen fish products (including bagged IQF shrimp in all sizes from around the world) are readily available at retail.
The range of more highly processed products is also extensive, originating from EU-based processors, South Africa, Australia, Malaysia, Oman and other suppliers.
Likewise, there is also an established market and consumer demand for smoked salmon and canned products.
In the Fall 2006, a special section of the Dubai fish market opened to cater to consumers seeking live fish.
Emirates Aqua Live is the first such fish outlet in the UAE, and supplies both to individuals, as well as top restaurants.
Their special facility carries all the regional fish, live crabs, lobsters, and others.
Opportunity for Canada?
Canada currently exports a variety of fish and seafood to this market, including fresh and frozen lobster, frozen shrimp, scallops and crab, smoked salmon, and canned fish products, and the opportunities continue growing.
On the supply front, considerable media debate was generated in the Fall (2006) with Dr Worm's (Dalhousie University, N.S.) extensive study published in the journal Science.
As we understand it, the Study essentially argues that should current trends be maintained, seafood could all but disappear from the human diet by 2048.
Within the context of the debate that this gave rise to in the UAE, the Ministry responsible for the fishery submitted that the threat of depleted fish stocks will not affect the UAE.
This the Ministry attributed to the release of more than a half-million hatchery fish a year into the Gulf...and their efforts to release more.
As mentioned above, they also underscored their not allowing "big companies" with trawlers to operate in coastal waters.
For our part, we don' t quite know how to square this with press headlines which scream "Price of local fish hits the roof" , and "Fish export ban imposed as traders struggle to meet demand" ...but we suppose that's simply our failing!
HALAL PRODUCTS Halal literally means "what is permissible" under Islam.
Halal food must be free of alcohol, pork and other prohibited substances.
In addition, meat and meat products must be from animals slaughtered according to Islamic guidelines.
Some recent reports have argued that most food companies in the region have not understood the direction the global halal market is taking, and they will have to adapt if they wish to eke out a share of this growing market by adopting contemporary industry trends.
Analysts note that food companies in most Middle Eastern countries take their consumers for granted.
Compared to buying halal food in other countries, consumers in overwhelmingly Muslim countries are seen as accepting what is on offer without raising too many questions.
The halal food-wave has already happened in Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa.
They suggest that it is just starting in the Arab world, and consumers are becoming more conscious of halal branding of food products.
It is believed that consumers in the region will buy halal products from non-Arab companies, if they do not find the properly certified products on their grocery shelves.
A study puts the global retail market for halal food at between US$400-580 billion a year (i.e., based on per capita expenditures on food by Muslims).
A breakdown of the 1.5 billion Muslim consumers around the world suggests both a substantial Middle Eastern market, as well as opportunities for re-export from Dubai to other impressive market sizes (180 million in Indonesia, 140 million in India, 130 million in Pakistan, 200 million in the Middle East, 300 million in Africa, 14 million in Malaysia, and over 8 million in North America).
September 2006 saw the successful introduction of a new "halal" trade show, DIHAS 2006, in Dubai.
Although only 60 companies, mostly from Malaysia, exhibited at this inaugural event, the venture appears to hold promise for this growing segment and will run again in 2007.
At time of writing, the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) is the only Canadian halal certifying body that has been approved to certify for export to the UAE.
However, efforts continue with the objective of obtaining approval for additional Canadian certifiers.
ORGANICS AND OTHER HEALTHFUL MATTERS Organics - domestically at the farm production level in the UAE, the Ministry responsible for agriculture is encouraging the pursuit of organic farming, mainly as an environmentally friendlier alternative to current practices.
The answer is a resounding "no" . Organic products are evident in most retail food product categories, and Canada continues to build a steady presence in this segment.
Canadian breakfast cereals, granola bars, jams and wild rice are readily available on the "organic" supermarket shelves.
We believe that opportunities exist for a greater presence in this niche segment.
The December 2006 publication of Canada's Organic Products Regulations will now underpin consumers' confidence against false organic claims, and govern the use of a new "Canada Organic" logo.
Organic exporters will now be able to compete on a far stronger footing internationally with the over 40 other countries worldwide that have enacted organic regulations.
Coupled with this regulatory framework is the launch in 2007 of a four-year pilot project to track Canadian trade data on organic products...a world first!
Having this information available will prove valuable in measuring both performance and demand for these products in various markets.
In short, these newest of tools auger well for the promotion of this specialised horizontal cross-sector in the global marketplace, including the UAE of course.
Diabetes - one in every four UAE adults is believed to be affected by diabetes according to the UN's World Health Organization (WHO).
This rate is one of the highest incidence in the world.
Both diabetes and childhood obesity are major health concerns, and the two go largely hand-in-hand, with Type II diabetes (i.e., usually referred to as "adult onset" diabetes) now growing far more common among younger individuals.
Some 96% of the UAE's diabetic population are Type II which, although not insulin dependant, requires close management through proper food intake (i.e., given a diet's significant role in helping control blood-sugar levels).
Indeed, WHO has estimated UAE youths to be 2-3 times more obese than the international standard, and the link between being overweight and diabetes is generally unquestioned.
This unfortunate situation does however present a number of opportunities for Canada.
These can be seen not only in terms of specialty products aimed specifically at this particular segment, but more significantly for products that are not only helpful to diabetics, but support good nutrition principles for the population as a whole.
Notable in this latter area is the success enjoyed by Canadian pulse exporters which, at time of writing, have seen there exports to the UAE rise by over 100% when compared to last year alone.
As a staple, pulses find themselves well positioned as "low" on the Glycaemic Index (GI) scale1, a feature which is particularly helpful to diabetics, but no less healthful for the population at large.
As Canada's pulse export base to this market grows, promoting this key aspect of certain [Canadian] peas, beans and lentils will take on added significance in terms of positively identifying Canada with healthy foods.
The same notion also applies to products like breakfast cereals based on oats, barley or bran, breads with whole-grains, stone ground flour, and the like.
For example, the recent arrival of Catelli's Healthy Harvest whole-wheat pasta line at retail in this market is illustrative of our ability to capitalize on this growing segment, as are the Nature's Path line of cereals.
This potential edge is not being lost on other exporters to the UAE as well.
Sona Pearl Nutri Rice is a new "scientifically engineered" low GI, aromatic rice marketed to "health conscious adults and children."
At a GI rating of 44, it is promoted as being less than half the level of most other rices.
Other available products on grocery shelves include the likes of Scotland's Nairn's line of oat biscuits and oat cakes.
They are clearly labelled on their front panel as to their "medium GI" or "low GI" ranking.
Cargill has also entered the growing movement to the low GI approach by announcing its recent introduction of a new food sweetening ingredient, XTENDTM Isomaltulose.
It delivers both glucose and fructose (with their full energy), but they are released over a longer period of time.
Maple syrup - yes, that Canadian stalwart is well represented on grocery shelves, and yes it does feel a little strange following a piece on diabetic foods with a comment on maple syrup.
However, the popular press has drawn UAE consumers' attention to the "London phenomenon" of significant success in weight-loss dieting by drinking maple syrup.
We understand that London health food shops are reporting a massive surge in sales since pop-idol Beyonce (I' ll have to ask my daughter!) said she used it to loose weight in her latest film.
Apparently, dieters mix the syrup (made from maple and palm tree sap) with water, lemon juice and cayenne pepper, and drink it instead of eating meals.
London-based Planet Organics sell it as a detox product, but customers soon noticed they could loose weight quickly with the concoction as well.
I won' t venture any further at this point, nor hazard a guess as to whether this phenom will catch on widely here as it has done in Europe...other than to note that this Canadian of Canadian products has received considerable media attention in the Emirates on the healthful eating side of the ledger.
We eagerly consumed gallons of the stuff.
Now, as the media reports in this market, the Minnesota Medical Association has opened a new front in the war on obesity.
Apple, orange and other juices are blamed in part for the fattening of America's children.
In a somewhat less than vigorous defence, one expert from the Institute of Medicine (Washington, DC) noted that "...[juice] is probably more nutritious than drinking water."
Well again, who are we to get caught up in the arguments of the nutrition experts.
We would note that fruit juice is not only a children's drink in the UAE, but also an adult social staple in this Islamic environment.
There is no dinner, reception, or other event where ample quantities of a wide and exotic array of fruit juices are not being consumed.
Simply put, fresh fruit juice is ubiquitous in this part of the world.
Although the reported study findings did receive considerable media attention, it is hard to imagine at this stage that demand for juices will abate in any significant way.
In fact, a UAE-based market research report found that consumers here are drinking more juice products, approaching 50 litres per annum, with emphasis remaining on pure juices and nectars.
So, during the limited review period covered by this newsletter...on the healthful side in the UAE, that's apparently a thumbs-up to maple syrup, and a thumbs-down to fruit juices...interesting, but who might have guessed?
Honey - in yet another media splash focussing this time on honey, also a great Canadian product, a New Zealand biochemist visited the UAE market to persuade health officials to put away the antibiotics and "...use the sweet stuff to heal injuries."
More specifically, the product that is being brought to the UAE combines honey with a cloth-like material derived from seaweed (which Canada also has plenty of) that dissolves away without leaving any threads to fester in a wound.
We might sound a little apprehensive about the good Professor since the event that started him off on his quest was his use of bull semen, given its anti-bacterial properties, and that he first used honey when he accidentally cut himself with a chain saw...but there you go.
The Professor is reported to have publicly volunteered to offer his advice freely to any company that wants to do anything seriously.
In our bid to have Canada at the forefront of neutriceuticals and the like, we say what's the harm in investigating further!
In terms of more traditional uses, a very wide range of honeys are available on retail shelves, both by type/flower origin and country source (e.g., U.S., Germany, UK, Australia, NZ, China, in addition to Gulf-product from Oman and Saudi Arabia).
Honey has always been an important diet component in this part of the world, and is also traditionally served during Ramadan observances.
In fact, the Qur' an states that in honey there is healing...and it is the only mention in the Holy Book of a food item in this context.
Its sweetening characteristics are used widely, from tea to yogurt.
In short, it's a competitive well-serviced market, with little technically preventing Canadian honey from being a player.
RETAIL There's no mistaking it, the UAE is a shoppers' heaven!
Residents and visitors alike pound the retail corridors relentlessly...in fact recent AC Nielsen figures estimate some 492 million cumulative person-hours are spent annually by UAE residents in hypermarkets and supermarkets alone.
In case you' re a reader attracted by factoids of dubious value, that's equivalent to the hours that would be spent constructing 70 Empire State buildings a year.
And speaking of the U.S., Dubai has four times the shopping area per capita when compared to Canada's southern neighbours.
The average UAE consumer spends some 127 hours in supermarkets per year, and embarks on shopping trips nearly 4 times every week.
Retail, and food retailing in particular, is economically important and highly competitive.
Retail prices - as a non-Muslim outsider, initial exposure to some of the practices which surround the holy month of Ramadan (expected to be September 12 to October 11 in 2007) gives rise to some unexpected, yet interesting food-related phenomena.
Readers would have knowledge of the sunrise-to-sunset fasting element observed throughout the month.
However, we assume few would have given significant thought as to what happens once the sun falls.
One can readily appreciated that once the fasting day ends, practitioners of the faith would understandably want to eat.
However, the nature of this fast-breaking, the importance attached to the evening's plentiful and celebratory meal (Iftar), how this is often done as a "community" of one type or another (be it family, friends, or any other groupings on a given night), and of course the role food plays in this daily occurrence, are all adjuncts that impact the food sector.
These centre on the placing of significant peak-load demands on the various sub-sectors (retail, foodservice, catering), that must respond nightly in terms of quality, variety and quantity of food products.
In turn, these considerations present both many challenges and opportunities on the food supply, distribution and sales systems.
At the retail level, the print media (for one) closely follows retail prices and reports on same in considerable detail.
Factions argue that 50-100% increases in fruit and vegetable prices, for example, are a result of retailers falling prey to monopoly wholesalers...while others counter-argue that it's simply the acting out of basic market forces.
So, for roughly a 30-day period, food is a key component of media attention touching on everything from public health and the best ways to break a fast, to traffic safety (not a small issue in Dubai) with headlines like "Avoid speeding in rush to break your fast, say police!" , to reviews of restaurants'special offerings, to import policy where in 2006, the UAE's Ministry of Economy moved to allow the unrestricted importation of basic food items in order to avoid price manipulation, to even having the leadership murmuring about the need for food price caps (which even though not implemented, is not inconceivable when one considers that a number of the emirates have recently moved to freeze soaring rents for example).
Why is this of any relevance to potential Canadian exporters?
Well, largely because it's a lead-in to "pricing" and availability at the retail level.
In short, the UAE government produces a retail price survey on a weekly basis, which is widely reported on.
The calculations are based on a basket of 44 items considered as "essential" (although that term appears to be a little loosely defined).
The UAE produces only 12 of these 44 items.
Most of the local items include fresh meat and dairy products and some produce.
Chicken, beef and eggs are all produced in the UAE, as well as pasta, tomato paste and sugar.
Cucumbers and packaged beef samosas round out the list of locally produced items.
Although these relatively few items are produced in the UAE, they must also face aggressive competition from imports as well.
It's simply another illustration of the food-deficit situation this part of the world finds itself in.
Private labelling - the rapid expansion of supermarket and hypermarket space across the Middle East finds private labelling to be alive, well and growing in the retail food sector.
UAE food+ cooperatives on the other hand, are ahead in terms of actual purchase percentages.
In the UAE, private labels now represent more than 15% of supermarkets' grocery turnover.
Continued new growth - pioneering French retail giants Carrefour and Casino are making the biggest investments in Middle East food retailing, with several other regional retailers trying to follow suit.
In 1995, Carrefour acquired its first store in Dubai (as the result of a buy-out), thereby bringing the "hypermarket" concept to the Middle East.
For the next six years, Carrefour essentially had free rein up until 2001 when the first Géant, from the French-owned Groupe Casino, opened in Bahrain.
Since then, Géant-branded hypermarkets have opened in Lebanon (1), Saudi Arabia (5) and Dubai (1).
Plans have been announced to rollout further stores, especially in Saudi Arabia.
With an estimated US$1 billion turnover in the Middle East, Carrefour is not sitting idly by.
From its initial foothold in the UAE, the brand now has upwards of 20 stores, most recently culminating in the largest hypermarket in the region located in Dubai (2005).
It is planning a raft of additional outlets (i.e., Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Beirut, Cairo, Alexandria, Amman, possibly more in the UAE, and perhaps Iran).
But the cornerstone of the chain's future development in the region appears to be its ambitious plans for Saudi Arabia.
Carrefour is reported to want to launch more than 20 additional stores in the Kingdom over the next 10 years.
Their presence in the UAE now includes 10 stores.
The following table provides readers with a concrete idea of the relative size and ranking of only those major grocery retailers that also have operations in the UAE.
Understandably, the 2005 retail "banner sales" (in million US$s) used for the ranking, relates to each chain's total sales across Middle East/North Africa, and is not to be confused with their respective total sales in the UAE: 1.
Al Maya 159 Considerable media attention was paid in 2006 to Harrods' reported plans to establish a presence on the Dubai retail scene.
Famous branded stores are of course already very present in Dubai (e.g., Harvey Nichols...which features B.C.'s CANAQUA spring water, Saks Fifth Avenue, Marks & Spencer, etc.). However, what caught our attention was that Harrods was reportedly going to enter solely as a "food and well-being" retailer under the Harrods 102 name (i.e., their relatively new convenience/high-end concept food store chain in the UK), rather than introduce its full London department store format.
Although analysts were predicting that Harrods would initially focus on high quality convenience foods, subsequent media reporting suggests that Harrods' entry into the UAE market is not imminent.
In November, Marks & Spencer announced intentions to expand its current 4-store presence in the UAE as part of its global plans to open 15 new international stores in 2006...and as we all know, where M&S goes, their extensive line of quality St. Michael branded food products follows.
Canadian products - as the growth in Canada's agri-food export statistics to the UAE might suggest, the good news is that keeping tabs on new products showing up on retail grocery shelves is a growing challenge.
The well-established ranks of McCain frozen potato products, Baskin Robbins ice cream, assorted pulses, Nature's Path organic breakfast cereals, canola oil, Connors Bros' Bumble Bee brand canned fish products, wild rice and maple syrup...to name a few, are constantly being added to.
Most recent new arrivals have seen for example the Catelli line of whole grain pasta products, and CANAQUA bottled water.
In short, UAE importers/distributors we are in contact with continue to be enthused by Canadian products and are very welcoming, indeed encouraging of the Canadian presence.
HRI/FOODSERVICE The market - the Middle Eastern foodservice market is estimated to be worth more than US$31 billion annually, of which the GCC countries account for almost US$9.5 billion.
The UAE foodservice market alone was worth US$4.36 billion (2004), and is conservatively predicted to grow at 11% for 2005 and 2006.
Dubai and Abu Dhabi account for 80% of total foodservice demand amongst the seven emirates.
In addition to the UAE resident population's considerable expenditures in this sector, latest economic studies estimate total spending by tourists will reach US$7.6 billion in 2009, which is expected to be the highest consumption rate in the GCC...and at three meals a day plus snacking on the run, the foodservice segment will attract its own significant portion of that total outlay.
Asian cuisine is the most popular of all cuisines and is growing the fastest.
Lebanese food is also continuing to be popular as it suits Arabic tastes and is also relatively healthy.
Coffee chains are also showing excellent growth, and Canada-based operations are very active in this segment with franchises like Second Cup, Café Suprême, Blenz, Café Céramique, and most recently Java U from Montréal, all present in the market.
These 4 channels make up roughly two-thirds of total foodservice expenditure on their food inputs and supplies.
Based on research interviews carried out with distributors in the UAE, the fastest growing categories in the segment are poultry, lamb/mutton, fresh fruit and vegetables, and processed meat and poultry (i.e., halal).
Also noteworthy is the increasing popularity of low-fat versions of products, Asian sauces and ingredients, bakery products, coffee and specialty cheeses.
The major factors supporting growth in the UAE's foodservice industry include: population growth, currently averaging over 7% per annum; rising rates of private consumption expenditure which also have the effect of driving up foodservice expenditures; three-quarters of the population are non-nationals, with a large percentage of this segment being male bachelors (in fact, males outnumber females two-to-one); given the prevalent working lifestyle, most people are compelled to eat at least one meal per day while at work; and finally, the impact of well over 6 million (and climbing relentlessly) tourist visits annually...hotels alone account for 17% of total foodservice expenditure.
In fact, Dubai has set a target of attracting 10 million tourists in 2010.
And for those wanting yet another different spin on the hotel room growth number, one of the world's leading hotel investments services projects that 55,000 luxury four and five-star hotel rooms are expected to be completed in the next 5 years across the UAE.
By comparison, Las Vegas is second with a construction pipeline currently at 42,000 rooms, and Macao (third) at 27,000.
Canada appears well-positioned to take advantage of a number of opportunities in this market segment.
These would range from supplying inputs to the highly price sensitive fast food component (e.g., from canola seed for crushing and use as frying oil, wheat for milling and baking, frozen potato products, etc.), to important opportunities apparent in the hotel segment where premium fish and seafood products, high quality beef and yes, pork, all come readily to mind.
Fast foods - according to several analysts, traditional fast food outlets stand to face increased competition from companies billing themselves as both "fast" and "healthy".
They are all eager for a slice of the UAE's US$117 million fast food market.
We know that in North America and Europe, the trend for some years has seen consumers gravitating towards what they consider as healthier eating alternatives.
And so, as Dubai's consumer base becomes increasingly westpat-oriented, there could well be emulation in terms of a steady shifting away from traditional "fast foods" , towards those healthier alternatives as well.
In support of this thesis, some analysts suggest that consumers' health concerns explain, at least in part, the somewhat unspectacular growth in UAE fast food outlets.
They only reached 315 this year, when compared to 275 in 2003.
Sushi, Gourmet Burger and Australian brand Sumo Salad have either been introduced to the UAE, or are on their way to do battle in their efforts to save consumers' midriffs against this segment's well-established McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, Pizza Hut, bulwark.
Despite growing health awareness, experts say there remains immense scope for growth in the UAE's fast food market.
Aware of this potential, McDonald's for example (with its 43 restaurants to date in the UAE), has introduced several meals directly targeting the Mid-East market, such as the McArabia grilled kofta and grilled chicken.
Gross Leasable Area (i.e., the retail space which is available to rent to tenants) per capita in the UAE is currently reported at the 0.98 mark.
Compare this to the U.S. average of about 1.9 and it seems evident to analysts that there is plenty of room for mall and non-mall retail growth, and by extension, plenty of room for growth in the fast food segment.
Analysts predict with some confidence that the future room for growth will follow the growth trend of the malls...and the latter remains indeed very bullish.
Franchising - tourism and population growth across the Middle East are creating new opportunities for the region's US$14 billion franchise sector.
For example, Dunkin' Donuts, the world's largest coffee and baked goods chain, has recently announced it intends to open 15 new outlets in the UAE alone during 2007.
This U.S. franchise has operated in the region for more than 10 years, and the additions will bring their regional presence to some 50 outlets.
In the UAE, a number of Canadian eatery franchises are in the process of, or have already, established themselves.
Second Cup, Blenz, Café Suprême, Java U and Café Céramique have been previously mentioned, but New York Fries, Saint Cinnabon, and Cinnzeo are also illustrative...with Dixie Lee chicken soon to open as well.
INVESTMENT As most can readily appreciate, a quick look around Abu Dhabi or Dubai provides immediate evidence that the Emirates are beneficiaries of huge investment capital inflows.
Many of the world's multinationals, across all sectors, continue to aggressively take advantage of the growth phenomenon that is the Emirates, as well as the Gulf more generally.
Over the last decade, the UAE has made significant strides and achieved the largest regional foreign direct investment (FDI) in terms of magnitude, rising from a lowly 90th position worldwide in 1995, to rank 15th in 2005.
However, there's also ample evidence that UAE companies are actively investing abroad as well.
Again this straddles most sectors, from real estate and hotel properties, sport franchises, port facilities, to agriculture and food.
In terms of outward investment, the media has India touted as the current "greatest opportunity."
That doesn't mean that one is not barraged on a daily basis by near-constant news of mega-high profile deal announcements in other parts of the world.
These range from constant rumours of purchasing Liverpool FC (a deal with an expected price tag of over C$1 billion, and for which the bidding has been against George Gillett, owner of the Montréal Canadiens), Emirates Airlines heavy investment in Arsenal's new football stadium, plus a C$200 million FIFA sponsorship, acquisition of the Tussaud Group theme parks (C$1.7 billion), Travel Lodge hotels (C$1.5 billion), a billion-plus stake in Daimler-Chrysler, Istithmar's plans to spend over C$8 billion in media and manufacturing in Europe and North America, and on-and-on...from C$700 million investments in the centre of Beirut, to C$20 billion in Egypt's tourism development projects, to International Schools in Singapore, to Moroccan agriculture.
The news barrage on this front is endless.
For many decades, many Indian's seeking to advance themselves economically looked to the UAE.
Full of entrepreneurial skills, they were eager to invest their efforts in making the vision crafted for Dubai a reality.
And now we are witness to a steady stream of investment flowing in the opposite direction.
India's retail sector stands at C$250 billion and growing at 5-7% a year.
Carrefour (Europe's largest and world's second largest retailer) is in talks with Dubai's Landmark Group about opening up to 200 stores in India over the next 10 years.
This foray would take advantage of India's lack of a major international food retailing chain despite the growing demand of the expanding middle class for quality and variety from food retailers.
It would also dovetail nicely with India's 30% annual growth in "organized retail", notably malls.
By contrast, the UK's TESCO has seen its India plans skid to a halt as its negotiations with an Indian joint venture partner (Bharti Enterprises) came to an abrupt end.
Bharti is now aligning itself with Wal-Mart.
The point of all this is simple.
The UAE both welcomes investment, but likewise appreciates the importance of balancing risk by looking to invest aggressively around the world and across a wide range of sectors as well.
In this respect, it clearly presents an interesting opportunity for sourcing potential FDI in the Canadian agri-food sector.
TREND-BITS... random food for thought!
New products - after 20 years of intensive scientific research at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (Dubai), Emirates Industry for Camel Milk & Products has released its first camel milk product "Camelicious" to the UAE market.
Indeed, the date-flavoured version is claimed as a world-first.
So you ask, of what possible significance is this to Canadian agri-food exporters?
Well, the product launch picked-up extensive media coverage in late 2006, and although taste panel results (largely among expats) were mixed, the marketing focus plays generously on one of the recurring themes in this newsletter...health and nutritional awareness of products will continue growing in the UAE, and will increasingly become an important food marketing tool.
Will your humble servant try it?
You betcha... eventually!
Horses - December 2006 saw a fulsome Canadian equestrian industry participation as exhibitors within a Canada Pavilion at the Al Fares Equine Trade Fair (Dubai).
The Fair, which is considered the number 1 exhibition for horse products and services in Asia and Africa, occurs every two years.
The 2006 event included the largest Canadian presence yet with some nine exhibitors, as well as two Canadian expert speakers contributing to the various seminars held at the venue.
Animal welfare - yes, the animal rights element of the sector have begun to make their presence felt in this part of the world as well.
In taking on Australian live sheep exports (some 230,000 per annum) to the UAE, U.S.-based PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) lobbied at the Ministerial level, arguing that the week-long journey is not halal.
PETA's same campaign in Qatar likewise received considerable media coverage.
As one would expect, Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) launched an aggressive rebuttal to PETA's claims, noting that "our colleagues in the Middle East need to be aware that PETA cannot be trusted and this is just another example of the havoc PETA's games cause."
The bottom line is simply that, as in other developed country markets, the animal welfare issue is now also making its way to the Gulf in a visible way.
Cruise ships - those affluent mouths-to-feed just keep on coming.
Dubai's cruise tourism industry is set for a major turn in its fortunes in 2007, after years of slow growth, as the Emirate's modern infrastructure and positive tourism "attitude" attracts more visitors.
Dubai is expected to see 85,000 passenger movements during the 2006-07 winter cruise season, which is more than three times the previous year's arrivals.
The 2007-08 season is projected by the tourism authority at 200,000 visitors via cruise lines.
With a dedicated cruise terminal able to handle two ships simultaneously, the city is trying to position itself as the regional cruise hub.
Goji berries - again with the "health" already!
Media coverage in the Emirates was also afforded this particular berry which grows on Hymalayan vines.
Touted as a "super-fruit" which is claimed to boost sex, fight cellulite and combat cancer, it is packed with nutrients and viewed to be in "a different league" than acclaimed super-fruits like blueberries and black currants.
The growing presence in the UAE market of neutriceuticals, herbals, anti-oxidents, supplements, et al, suggests that it is probably time for Canada's own particular entries (e.g., hemp, flax, vegetable-based Omega 3, etc.), to begin exploring these opportunities as well.
We recommend a visit to the Middle East Natural and Organic Products annual trade show, held in Dubai in December, as a good initial starting point in terms of investigating the potential offered by this segment.
This particular venue brings together all those involved in this industry, directly or indirectly, under one roof.
What's in a name - in Egypt, the name of an influential personality is chosen every year, and is then applied to the finest grade of that year's dates.
This year, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nesrallah's name was chosen by a wide margin for the premium dates, which cost over C$5 per kg...the next lower grade earns about C$2-3 per kg.
Other than being generally interesting, and no, we are not advocating a cause or group in any particular way...we feel that it is probably noteworthy when contemplating markets in this part of the world that there is merit in reflecting on the significance/meaning of one's product "name" or personality-association carefully...the risks and/or rewards for doing so might not always be readily apparent! ...and lastly - in November Huguette Labelle, chair of Transparency International, released that organizations "Corruption Index" for 2006.
We are pleased to report that the Emirates ranked as the least corrupt of the GCC countries, and 31st overall.
I suppose that depends on one's perspective.
For example, Canada ranked 14th and the U.S. 20th, whereas the likes of Israel, South Korea and Brazil/China/India/Mexico/Saudi Arabia (the latter as a group) picked-up rankings of 34, 42 and 70 respectively.
So yes, we believe it to be a relatively solid endorsement of the UAE business environment indeed!
Not all carbohydrate foods are created equal, in fact they behave quite differently in our bodies.
The Glycaemic Index describes this difference by ranking carbohydrates according to their effect on our blood glucose levels.
Choosing low GI carbohydrates - those that produce only small fluctuations in our blood glucose and insulin levels - is considered by experts to be important to long-term health reducing risk of heart disease and diabetes, and is key to sustainable weight loss.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY There were 135 biotechnology companies in Israel in 1999 with a total of $600 million1 in sales, 3800 employees and exports estimated at $550 million.
The biotechnology market is expected to be valued at $1.2 billion in 2000 and $2.6 billion by 2003.
Analysts predict that by 2003, as many as 200-250 companies will be working in this sector and that investments will grow to $1.4 billion.
Pharmaceutical and diagnostics firms represent 72% of the Israeli biotechnology industry.
Israel has one of the world's most skilled and educated work forces, with more doctors, scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation.
The reputation of Israel's work force, as well as lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world, makes Israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships.
There is strong government support for the biotechnology industry within Israel through programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators, and encourage bi-national co-operation.
However, despite a rapidly expanding medical and pharmaceutical industry, the Israeli market is still quite immature and dependent on imported goods.
In order to reduce the costs of medication and encourage more competition in the market, the Health and Justice ministers signed regulations to allow parallel imports of pharmaceuticals in May 2000.
Despite continued opposition from international pharmaceutical companies, the regulations will take effect on September 1, 2000.
Characterized by a high level of competition, Israel is expected to become a centre for the development of pharmaceuticals, especially generic brands.
Best prospects for growth in the industry are in bio-electronics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and structure based drug design.
Pure biotechnology drug discovery requires greater investment and a longer development time, postponing marked growth in this sector until the Israeli market matures.

MARKET OVERVIEW Israel is a modern and diverse country of over 6 million people, located on a narrow strip of land along the east shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
With the third-highest growth domestic product (GDP) per capita in the developing world (after Hong Kong and Singapore), Israel ranks as one of the most competitive nations of the 21st century.
While the small size of the Israeli economy has limited the country's capital resource base, the expertise of the work force has proven to be it's most important commodity.
Home to one of the world's most skilled and educated work forces (the majority of whom speak English), Israel has more scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation and approximately 4.5 physicians to every 1000 people.
Israel boasts leading researchers in life sciences, computer technology and engineering who produce a noteworthy 1% of the world's scientific publications.
An estimated 35% of all academic scientists in Israel work in the life sciences field and spend 40-50% of all academic research funding.
By 1997, the biotechnology industry had commercialized 19 products, with 32 in clinical trails awaiting approval, and 50 more at the research and development phase.
There were 135 biotechnology companies in Israel in 1999 (an increase from only 25 companies in 1988), with sales of $600 million and exports estimated at $550 million.
Sales of biotechnology products are expected to top $1.2 billion in 2000 and are forecasted to reach $2.6 billion by 2003.
There were 3800 people employed in the biotechnology sector in 1998, an 8% increase from the previous year.
Analysts predict as many as 200-250 companies working in this sector by 2003, with investments growing to $1.4 billion in the same period.
Pharmaceutical and diagnostics firms represent 72% of the Israeli biotechnology industry; agricultural biotechnology accounts for 20%; and the remainder includes veterinary and environmental applications.
Biopharmaceuticals are the most significant sector of the Israeli biotechnology market.
However, the distinction between traditional pharmaceutical firms and those employing biotechnology in the development of medical products is difficult to establish.
As the science behind biotechnology develops, many traditional pharmaceutical companies are turning their attention to the potential of biotechnology in both product development and manufacturing technologies.
The estimated domestic value of the pharmaceutical market in Israel in 1998 was $1.1 billion, growing at an average rate of about 10% annually.
Sales by domestic manufacturers totalled $1.35 billion in 1998; 50% of total sales were exported.
In spite of a rapidly expanding medical industry, the Israeli market is still quite dependent on imported goods.
Imported pharmaceuticals were approximately 40% of the total market in 1998, or $720 million.
Currently, the vast majority of Israel's pharmaceutical exports are to the United States and the European Union, particularly the United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands.
Total exports are forecast to rise to $1.1 billion by 2000 and to more than double to $2.3 billion by 2003.
In 1996, the over-the-counter (OTC) drug market represented 12% of Israel's total national drug market, compared with 20% in the United States and 28% in both France and Germany.
Annual OTC consumption in Israel averages $12 per capita, well below average for most westernized countries.
The OTC market is predicted to be one of the most promising growth sectors in coming years.
There is strong government support for the biotechnology industry within Israel through programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators, and encourage bi-national co-operation (see the Key Contacts section for a complete listing of biotechnology incubators).
The Ministry of Industry and Trade sponsors training projects, or industrial incubators, which partner new immigrants to Israel who have backgrounds in science and technology with experienced Israeli entrepreneurs.
The mentor's role is to assist with the process of moving promising ideas through research and to commercialization.
The program has been very successful, particularly with Russian immigrants who have the technical experience in life sciences, but had not previously been encouraged to pursue individual initiative.
The National Biotechnology Steering Committee, established in 1987, advises the Israeli government on the development of biotechnology, encourages research and entrepreneurial activities, and promotes international co-operation.
Government support also extends beyond research and development to include grants and incentives for start-up costs, marketing and infrastructure development.
The MAGNET program, administered by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, encourages development of innovative generic technologies through collaborations between industry and the scientific community.
MAGNET will underwrite up to 65% of a project's budget.
In 1998, four biotechnology projects received funding under this program.
In 1999, the program received a budget allotment of $300 million over five years.
MAGNET also established a bioinformatics consortium called Da'at to encourage collaboration among 7 companies and 2 academic institutes.
Da'at received funding of $16 million over 5 years.
In order to bridge the gap between basic research and commercialization, the Government has established "national open centres".
The centres work on intermediate strategic research is areas such as protein purification and micro sequencing, genomic technologies and gene therapy, and high-throughput screening technologies.
Projects put through these centres are chosen by a panel that bases its decisions on scientific excellence and future applications.
Canadian companies interested in fostering research and development relationships with Israeli companies are also encouraged to consult the MATIMOP program.
MATIMOP is a public non-profit organization that promotes joint industrial development of advanced technologies.
The program's Web site contains a database outlining co-operative program opportunities that span a range of advanced technologies.
Key Factors Shaping Market Growth In spite of having the scientific know-how and personnel, the Israeli biotechnology industry has yet to achieve the level of maturity and development of its competitors, particularly the United States, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom.
While there has been some progress over the past decade with strong government support and the emergence of several large- and medium-sized firms with sufficient infrastructure to develop and test of drugs, further expansion of the infrastructure is needed, as well as the development of entrepreneurial ability in management.
The Israeli Biotechnology Organization is currently working in co-operation with the Israel Manufacturers' Association in implementing a fast-track management program aimed at matching successful executives with Israeli start-up companies.
Other developments to encourage growth in the biotechnology industry in Israel include the Clal Biotech Fund.
Led by Clal Biotechnology, a group of investors established a $150-million consortium to invest in biotechnology companies in 1998.
The group invested $22 million in Compugen and $3.8 million in Neuro Survival Technologies.
The Clal Biotech Fund is currently examining three investments in foreign companies in the US and Europe.
In addition to the Clal Biotech Fund, Koor Group and the Israel Corporation (among Israel's largest holding companies) have jointly established a $44 million fund dedicated to biotechnology investments.
The Ministry of Science, in cooperation with the Weizmann Institute of Science, established the Israel National Node (INN) for bioinformatics training and support in 2000.
The institute is part of the government's effort to strengthen R&D and manufacturing infrastructures by encouraging closer collaboration between academia and industry.
Israel has a strong reputation for a highly skilled work force, lower costs for conducting clinical trials as well as a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world.
Israel also has a highly diverse population as a result of years of immigration, providing researchers a heterogenous population for clinical trial research.
Israel also has a well-developed medical infrastructure, universal health insurance system and considerable number of physicians.
Companies from the United States and the European Union are increasingly interested in the research and development environment in Israel, further encouraging growth in the industry.
There are hundreds of biotechnology projects currently being developed in Israel, most of which receive government funding.
A notable change in emphasis in recent years has been a move away from development of diagnostics and agricultural products to research on new pharmaceuticals.
Areas where major advances have been made include the use of molecular modeling to design new and improved drugs, synthetic polyamino acids for drug development, drug delivery techniques and drug design by peptide modification.
In 1998, Israel announced reformed drug import regulations that included major changes in pricing, importing and approvals for new drugs.
As described in more detail below, medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medical Regulations Agency will be approved by the Ministry of Health in Israel much quicker than those that have not received approval.
Further changes, as of February 1999, included allowing parallel drug imports.
In the past, any company registering an imported pharmaceutical with the Ministry of Health had a monopoly on the drug, whereby drugs were imported only by representatives with exclusive agreements with the manufacturer.
In response to proposed changes to allow parallel imports, 15 representatives of international pharmaceutical companies established a non-profit lobbying organization called Pharma Israel to oppose the measure.
The association members argued that medications supplied by the manufacturer ensure the quality of handling, packaging, storage and transportation.
They also argued that parallel imports may threaten intellectual property rights.
The Government argued in return that parallel imports would increase competition in the industry and could reduce the costs of some medications in Israel.
On May 30, 2000, the ministers of Health and of Justice signed regulations allowing parallel imports.
The regulations were signed after Clalit Health Services filed a lawsuit and the High Court of Justice responded by demanding an explanation for the delay.
Despite continued opposition from international pharmaceutical companies, the regulations will take effect on September 1, 2000.
The United States and Germany are Israel's most active scientific collaborators with programs including the Bi-National U.S.-Israel Science Foundation (BSF) and the Germany-Israel Foundation (GIF).
Israel receives the third-largest amount of grant funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health outside the United States.
Opportunities While there is a need for strategic alliance opportunities for small or medium-sized companies, the Israeli National Biotechnology Committee has predicted that new ventures and partnerships will result in sales of $1.1 billion in 2000 and reach $2.6 billion in 2003 - or six times more than 1997 sales.
Israel has a multilingual, immigrant population with cultural, historic and business ties to almost every other nation.
In recent years, over 700 000 immigrants have been absorbed from Russia, 67% of which were previously employed in professional, scientific, engineering or technical positions in the former Soviet Union.
This highly trained scientific elite offers significant growth opportunities in the industry and opportunities for Canadian firms to partner with small and medium-sized Israeli enterprises.
Israeli partners can help Canadian firms with technical expertise and commitment to ongoing research and development to enter the market, through strategic alliances and technology transfer agreements.
Best prospects for growth in the industry are in bio-electronics, bio-informatics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, and structure based drug design.
Pure biotechnology drug discovery requires greater investment and a longer development time, postponing marked growth in this sector until the Israeli market matures.
Currently, Israeli biotechnology firms tend to sell their technology to international investors or multinational concerns, rather than take the risk to develop the product further.
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT Local Capabilities In spite of recent growth, the Israeli pharmaceutical market remains relatively small.
The two main producers and importers, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Agis Industries, have a combined market share of 50-60%.
These and other companies, including Biotechnology General (BTG), Hazera, Interpharm (IPL), Orgenics, and Pharmos, have begun to build critical infrastructure for drug development and testing.
The close co-operation between the manufacturing sector and research institutes, universities and medical centres has resulted in a particularly efficient development of new products from the initial research phase through to manufacturing and marketing.
Characterized by a high level of competition, Israel is expected to become a centre for the development of pharmaceuticals, especially generic brands.
Teva has been particularly successful in the generic drug market.
International Competition By far, the largest biotechnology industry in the world is the United States, with Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Canada following.
More than 90% of advanced biotechnology products on the world market are health related and it is expected that about three quarters of the total world demand for biotechnology will continue to be in the health sector.
World sales of biopharmaceuticals have grown more than seven-fold over the past decade and should exceed $26 billion by 2003.
The biopharmaceutical portion of world prescription drug sales is expected to triple from 5% to 15% by 2005.
Canadian Position The Canadian biotechnology industry has flourished over the last several years.
With almost 500 companies, collective revenues of more than $1.9 billion and research expenditures of more than $1.5 billion, Canada is poised to become a world leader in pharmaceutical research and production.
Canadian pharmaceutical exports to Israel were estimated to be close to 1% of the market in 1997.
Fostering growth in the Canadian biotechnology sector is consistent investment in research and development, financial support by private and public agencies, a solid regulatory framework, strong human resources, and public acceptance of biotechnology-derived products.
In 1999, the Canadian government announced a $550-million increase in health research funding over three years and reinforced biotechnology as an important growth sector for the future.
The funding announcement included the creation of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, $200 million in additional funding for the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and $150 million in additional funding for Technology Partnerships Canada.
This commitment to biotechnology was strengthened in the federal budget in February 2000 with the announcement of $160 million to fund five genomic science centres across Canada, $900 million for university and hospital research infrastructure and $900 million for additional research chairs at Canadian universities.
The government also allocated $90 million to strengthen Canada's regulatory capacity in the area of biotechnology.
Canada's positive relations with the world's most prominent economies, as well as its global reputation for scientific excellence, give Canadian companies an advantage in expanding their businesses to overseas markets.
Canadian firms are well positioned to provide joint-venture partnerships and commercialization expertise, as well as a broad range of products resulting from Canadian research and development efforts.
Biovail of Mississauga, Ontario has recently signed an agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Israel's largest pharmaceutical company, to develop and market a line of delayed-release drugs produced by Biovail.
In December 1999, Teva signed a letter of intent to acquire Novopharm of Canada from Dan Family Holdings.
The value of the deal is approximately $385 million.
The acquisition did not include Novopharm Biotech and was finalized in June 2000.
Increased access has enhanced the competitiveness of Canadian suppliers to this market.
Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation Established in 1994, the Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation (CIIRDF) provides companies in either country with an introductory service for the purpose of creating R&D alliances.
The program contributes half of the costs of joint R&D projects (up to $50,000 over one year for approved pilot projects and up to $750,000 over three years to fund approved full-scale projects) for eligible Canadian or Israeli firms operated and headquartered in either Canada or Israel.
At least 30% of the cash costs on any individual project must be spent in either Canada or Israel, contributions are repayable from commercial revenues from the project.
For more information, contact the Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation.
Export Development Corporation Export Development Corporation (EDC) offers export financing and insurance to Canadian exporters.
Additionally, insurance can be provided for larger transactions that are subject to the terms and conditions established by the buyer.
EDC prefers to work through letters of credit, bank credits or bank guarantees.
Approval for financing is considered on a case-by-case basis.
Canadian Commercial Corporation The Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) gives Canadian companies access to financing and better payment terms under the Progress Payment Program (PPP).
The PPP concept was developed as a partnership between major Canadian financial institutions and the CCC.
It enables the exporter's bank to open a project line of credit for the exporter's benefit, based on CCC approval of the project and the exporter's ability to perform.
The CCC will also act as a prime contractor on behalf of Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises, giving those businesses increased credibility and competitive advantage.
The PEMD refundable contribution ranges from $5,000 to a maximum of $50,000.
Preference is given to companies with fewer than 100 employees for a firm in the manufacturing sector and 50 in the service industry, or with annual sales between $250,000 and $10 million.
Other components of the program include international bid preparation (Capital Project Bidding) and, for trade associations, developing international marketing activities for their membership.

PRIVATE-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Israel's 630 privately owned pharmacies represent the second largest group of customers for for pharmaceutical products (the publically funded health-care system is the primary customer).
The two largest drug store chains are SuperPharm and NewPharm.
The public sector consumes 90% of imported and locally produced pharmaceuticals.
Since 1995, health insurance is guaranteed to all Israeli citizens.
All residents are required to register with one of the health care organizations, which provide a standard and extensively subsidized selection of health services and drugs through one of four public "sick funds".
In January 2000, a total of 96 drugs and 22 medical procedures were added to the list for reimbursement and are expected to cost the Israeli government an additional $60 million per year.
The largest of the sick funds is Kupat Holim of the Histadrut (General Sick Fund of the Labour Union), which insures about 65% of the total insured (or about 3.5 million people) and operates about 1200 clinics in Israel.
It is the largest purchaser of drugs in Israel through a centralized purchasing scheme and a chain of in-house pharmacies.
The products sold through sick fund pharmacies have traditionally been the lowest prices in the market.

While open tenders are published in the local press, government-owned companies often use selective bidding practices whereby only selected companies are invited to bid on the contract.
Participation at annual trade fairs can help to develop company and product exposure to this market segment.
Government Procurement Regulations Under the Public Procurement Law and Regulations enacted in 1993, governmentowned companies and entities are required to procure by tender.
"Industrial Cooperation" regulations contain an offset clause for tenders over $735,000 (US$500,000) for the purchase of local products or use of local content for at least 35% of the cost of the contract.
Procurement is administered by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Although Israel is a signatory to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Code, the "Buy Israel" regulation awards a 15% advantage to local companies.
As well, the National Priority Zones Regulations award an additional 5-15% advantage to companies located in the national priority areas.
MARKET LOGISTICS Tel Aviv is Israel's commercial and financial centre.
Centrally located on the Mediterranean coast and having 25% of the population, it is where most companies are headquartered.
The two major seaports are Haifa in the north and Ashdod in the south, each having good transportation links to the rest of the country.
Channels of Distribution Good representation is the key to the Israeli market.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and well connected with key players.
Governed by the Agencies Act of 1965, general common law principles of agency law apply to the termination or cancellation of agency agreements.
An agreement for representation should specify the duration of the contract, provisions for exclusivity, compensation, promotional input and dispute settlement mechanisms.
Exporters new to the Israeli market are advised to appoint a local agent with an understanding of the local market; contacts with the Ministry of Health, the sick funds and other major players; and the ability to promote products effectively.
An importer of pharmaceutical products must have a licence and be a resident of Israel, or a representative of a corporation registered in Israel.
As a result, Canadian companies must either establish an office in Israel, or hire a distributor for their products.
For assistance locating an agent or distributor, contact the Canadian Embassy in Israel.
Suggested Business Practices The two official languages of Israel are Hebrew and Arabic, but English is widely spoken as the language of business and the one preferred for promotional materials.
Most signs in public places are in all three languages.
Yiddish, Russian, French and German are prominent among the languages used by immigrant groups.
The business environment is westernized but likely to be less formal in both dress (especially during the summer months), and the use of first names without titles.
Common office hours are from 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and from 8:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. on Friday.
Israel has no formal constitution.
It has a modern, independent legal system based on a number of Basic Laws covering key areas of public life - such as the electoral system, the Knesset (parliament) and the legal system - as well as British case law, which effectively enforces property and contractual rights.
Moreover, Israeli civil procedures provide that judgments from foreign courts may be accepted and enforced by local courts.
The financial sector is modern and efficient with a full range of financial institutions and instruments.
There are few restrictions on foreign investment and investors and the regulatory environment and tax system favour foreign companies and investors.
The Consular Affairs Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) provides country-specific travel information reports and advisories.
Intellectual Property Protection Israel is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Universal Copyright Convention and the Berne Copyright Convention.
As a member of the WTO, Israel is currently revising its laws to bring them into compliance with the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIP) Agreement.
Patents Israeli patent laws protects both the process and the product and is granted for 20 years from the date of the application, subject to payment of renewal fees.
The owner of a patent must provide a local address when applying for a patent and the title must appear in both Hebrew and English (specifications, however, may be in either English or Hebrew).
The "first to file" principal applies, whereby the first or prior use of a patent does not protect the owner from infringement by someone else who applies first for a patent in Israel.
The use of the services of a patent attorney are recommended.
Generic Drugs Through 1998 and 1999, Israel amended its patent laws to permit domestic manufacturers of generic drugs to develop generic versions of patented drugs prior to the expiration of the 20-year patent protection for the innovator.
While the laws restrict production for use in research and for filing applications to regulatory authorities, it has no effective safeguards to restrict commercial exports.
The Israeli pharmaceutical market previously relied on licensed technology from foreign companies, or had to license their technology to large-scale manufacturers.
Israeli generic drug manufacturers have now become large enough to undertake the commercial development of pharmaceuticals.
These companies are opposed to any delay in research and development until after the full period of patent protection has expired.
The revised Israeli patent laws allow Israeli generic alternatives to be marketed as soon as the patent expires, when Israel's competitors would only be starting development of alternatives.
This gives Israeli companies a jump start on generic drug competitors, and would likely result in Israeli generic manufacturers gaining a larger portion of the market.
Fearing the erosion of their competitive advantage, the United States and the European Union oppose Israel's revised patent laws and are currently considering taking the matter to the WTO under the TRIP Agreement.
Furthermore, the European Union and the United States do not allow imports of generics while the patented drug is still protected and have threatened sanctions against Israel over Israel's interpretation of the TRIP Agreement.
This objection, however, will not prevent other nations from purchasing Israeli exports.
Canadian exporters are advised to follow this issue closely and take all necessary precautions to protect intellectual property.
Trademarks Applications for trademark protection may be made by the owner or their agent with written authorization from the owner.
All applicants must present a local address and pay the required fee of approximately $175.
The term of protection for a trademark is seven years but is renewable indefinitely for periods of 14 years upon payment of required fees.
Priority of registration is given to the first local user of the trademark and every application must specify goods or services falling within one class only.
Under the terms of the Paris Convention, where an application to register a trade or service mark in another signatory country has been made, the applicant has a right to claim priority for registration of the same trademark in Israel for the same use.
Import Regulations Free trade agreements have been signed with the European Union (1975), the United States (1985), the European Free Trade Alliance (1992) and Canada (1997).
Under these agreements, there are no custom duties on pharmaceutical imports.
Israel pursues a liberal import policy under which tariffs on products from most third-party countries were lowered to between 8% and 12% by 1998.
Most imports are free of licensing and quantitative restrictions.
All imports are subject to a 15% c.i.f. (cost/insurance/freight) value port fee, as well as a value-added tax (VAT) of 17%.
The VAT is recovered by the importer upon the resale of the goods and ultimately paid by the consumer in the final retail price.
The Ministry of Health imposes strict controls on the importation of pharmaceuticals.
Medical drugs and substances for their preparation may be imported only through a licence holder who is either an Israeli resident or a representative of a company registered in Israel.
To obtain a licence, a Registration of Medicinal Products must be submitted to the Ministry of Health.
As of 1998, there has been a concerted effort to speed up the approval process for drugs imported from the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan and Australia.
Accordingly, drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medical Regulation Agency will be licensed by the Ministry within two months, rather than the usual 4-month period.
Regulations regarding the pricing of imported drugs were introduced in 1998 by the Minister of Health.
The previous regulations saw the importer use the price in the country of origin as a basis for the price in Israel.
Officials argued that this policy created artificially high prices by encouraging importers to purchase drugs from expensive sources.
The new regulation calls for prices to be set based on the lowestaverage price in Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Local Standards, Certificates or Registrations All imports into Israel must have a label indicating the country of origin, the name and address of the producer and the Israeli importer, the content, weight and volume.
In all instances Hebrew must be used.
English may be added provided the print is no larger than the Hebrew print.
In addition, specific labelling regulations may apply to various types of pharmaceuticals.
Exporters are advised to consult with the Israeli authorities or their local agent/importer to obtain specific requirements.
Export Credit Risks, Restrictions on Letters of Credit, Currency Controls The most common method of payment is through a letter of credit that guarantees payment.
Israeli importers prefer Cash Against Documents (CAD) and to collect an advance payment or an irrevocable bank guarantee on a portion of the shipment, given that there is no guarantee of payment with the CAD method.
The most common terms are 30, 60 and 90 days.

Readers should take note that the Government of Canada does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in this report, nor does it necessarily endorse the organizations listed herein.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Canadian agri-food exports to Israel in 2001 totalled $14.9 million(1).
The leading exports included lentils, non-alcoholic beverages, pet food, beans, sweet biscuits and peas.
Canada is Israel's top supplier of dried leguminous vegetables and is among the top three suppliers of soybeans and pet food.
The Israeli food market is moving toward a trend in convenience as evidenced by the many Israelis who are eating more prepared foods, fast foods and snacks.
Potential opportunities are available to exporters in several categories, including ready meals, savoury snacks, sauces and spreads.
The bakery, confectionery and pet food sectors are also promising markets for foreign goods.
Israel is already a major importer of Canadian grains, oilseeds and pulses with continued demand expected for the foreseeable future.
Canadian wines--particularly ice wines--are well-placed to develop a market share in Israel.
With the forecast growth of the private-label industry, significant opportunities also exist for Canadian manufacturers in nearly all product categories.
Israel's domestic food-processing sector is large, diverse and fairly modern by international standards.
Due to kosher requirements of the majority of the country's citizens, Israel has been forced to develop a relatively large food-processing sector.
Although non-kosher food products are produced and imported into Israel, together they account for less than 5% of the food market and their marketing channels are limited.
Exporters are therefore advised to export kosher products in order to achieve widespread distribution.
It is recommended that exporters consult with their Israeli importer prior to shipping.

MARKET OVERVIEW Israel offers a sophisticated and diversified marketplace for goods and services.
Despite its relatively small population of 6.3 million, Israel is still a country with a high volume of imports (both raw materials and finished goods).
Israel is experiencing an economic slowdown related to the Intifada, the world downturn and the high-tech slump.
Most sectors remain far below the peaks of 2000 and only weak recovery, at best, is forecast for this year.
The security situation has seen its greatest impact on traditional sectors such as tourism, construction and agriculture.
More significant overall has been the international economic slowdown, particularly given its impact on Israel's important high-tech sector and technology exports, on which a considerable part of Israel's economic boom had rested.
Nonetheless, Israel's new economy has shown remarkable resilience in the face of severe strain.
There is a sense among analysts and the business community that the business cycle will eventually turn around.
The United States accounts for approximately 30% of agri-food imports.
In 2001, Canadian agri-food exports to Israel totalled $14.9 million.
The leading exports included lentils (19.8%), non-alcoholic beverages (11.7%), pet food (9.6%), beans (7.8%), sweet biscuits (6.2%) and peas (5.3%).
By mid 2002, chickpeas were the top export followed by beans, peas, pet food, prepared fruit jams and lentils.
Kosher Kosher, which means right or clean, describes foods and practices that are specifically permitted by Jewish dietary laws.
With over 60% of the country's five million Jewish population maintaining some degree of kosher observance and a Moslem population of one million purchasing kosher food that meets the halal dietary requirement, Israel is the largest market in the world for kosher food.
Non-kosher food products, including locally produced and imported products, account for less than 5% of the food market and have limited marketing channels.
Although the import of non-kosher food is not forbidden (except for specific restrictions concerning meat and poultry products), its marketing in Israel is difficult.
Approximately half of the Jewish population consumes only kosher foods and most of this group does not shop in stores selling non-kosher products.
Therefore, the large consumer chains and many stores do not carry non-kosher goods.
The large food-processing plants also forgo the use of non-kosher raw materials in order not to lose this market segment.
The Israeli government monitors compliance with labelling requirements through the Ministry of Health(2).
Labelling of a foodstuff as kosher requires the certification of a Rabbi.
By law, the Chief Rabbinate is responsible for kosher certification, although it can delegate its authority to others.
Hence, goods can receive kosher certifications from rabbis in Canada but only with the concurrence of the Chief Rabbinate.
(See Key Contacts and Support Services for a list of kashrut(3) authorities in Canada.)
Rabbinical leaders of the ultra-orthodox sector contend that kosher certifications of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate do not meet the kashrut demands of their communities.
For maximum market coverage to the orthodox and/or ultra-orthodox market segments, products need additional certifications by some or all of the four main religious groups.
Foodstuffs may carry special orthodox/ultra-orthodox certifications to facilitate penetration of additional markets.
Exporters who wish to maximize their markets should comply with at least the Chief Rabbinate requirements.
Many food manufacturers in Israel display at least two kosher certification labels on their goods: the Chief Rabbinate plus an individual approval by one of the orthodox or ultra-orthodox sects.
Key Factors Shaping Market Growth Although Israel's food sector tends to be less sensitive to the overall economy than other sectors, food retailers have noted that consumers have become price sensitive and have reduced their purchases of luxury or high-priced items.
Hostilities in the region have also resulted in a significant decline in the number of people patronizing supermarkets.
According to a study carried out by an Israeli news station in July 2001, consumers are visiting shopping centres only half as much as they were in 2000.
Shoppers fear being caught in terrorist attacks, which often focus on shopping centres and other public spaces.
Food exports fell 4.2% in 2001 to $425 million compared with the previous year.
Elite Industries Ltd., for instance, has reported a 5% drop in sales of impulse products such as salty snack food and chocolate in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Decreases in sales, the company maintains, came as a result of the decline in tourism, pedestrian traffic and visits to entertainment complexes.
Economic slowdown due to Israel's security situation has not greatly affected the market for foreign products, however.
In fact, imports actually grew by 3.5% in 2001, totalling $870 million.
Israel's Manufacturers Association's Food Division have called on the government and consumers to buy locally made food products especially during these reversionary times.
Opportunities There are promising opportunities for Canadian exports in several food categories.
Strong growth in this sector is largely attributed to an increase of in-store bakeries and patisseries in supermarkets, which reflect the growing trend in Israel to buy rather than bake.
Sales of bakery products are expected to reach $2 billion or 4.4 million tonnes by 2005.
The most popular bakery products include fresh bread, which accounts for approximately 50% of in-store bakery sales, sweet biscuits, cakes, savoury baked items (e.g. filled filo-pastries and layered pastry leaves, such as jakhnun and malawah) and pizza.
Roldin, Israel's largest manufacturer of baked products, produces 300 different products, including cakes, breads, cookies and special products.
Elite Industries Ltd. is also a major supplier of wafers, cookies and cakes.
Many bakery items that are Western staples, including English muffins, some varieties of cakes, North American-style bagels and croissants have not been well-received in the Israeli food market.
Items such as pizza and frozen and chilled dough, however, are in high demand.
Opportunities for unique varieties of sweet biscuits and crackers are also available, although competition from local and European producers is fierce.
Sales of frozen bakery products are expected to grow steadily until at least 2005, reaching sales of $17.9 million.
Canadian exports of bakery items totalled almost $1 million in 2001.
Sales of sweet biscuits, which accounted for 6.2% of total Canadian exports last year, are expected to offer continued growth potential in the years to come.
Because the ingredients used in the production process of baked goods are so varied, exporters are advised to consult with Israeli importers to provide the specific guidance with regard to kosher certification for their products.
Additional certification may be required if eggs are present in the product.
Breakfast cereal is a category with tremendous growth potential.
Opportunities are available for unique and/or healthy varieties of breakfast cereal.
Although sales of private-label breakfast cereals have not been significant to date, demand is steadily increasing.
Private-label cereal is expected to be a huge market in years to come.
The United States, which supplies one third of the $18-million market, is Canada's main competitor in the market.
Pasta is among the fastest-growing items in terms of sales.
Israel's noodle and pasta market is currently estimated at $53 million annually with a estimated value of $57 million by 2005.
Exports of uncooked pasta from Canada jumped from $57 963 in 2000 to $203 174 in 2001 and have the potential for continued growth as demand grows.
Confectionery Products Israel is a promising market for imported confectionery products.
Chocolate is the best-selling segment of the confectionery sector.
Approximately 1.2 million tonnes of chocolate was sold in 2001 with sales expected to reach 2 million tonnes by 2005.
Chewing gum and sugar confectionery products (other than chocolate) are expected to reach sales of 646 000 and 647 000 tonnes, respectively by 2005.
Chocolate confectionery is expecting sales of $234 million in 2005, while gum and sugar confectionery are expected to reach $117 million and $114 million, respectively.
Firms in the confectionery industry compete on the bases of brand name, product advertising and promotion, specialty products, quality and cost of production.
Because confectionery products are usually discretionary and high-impulse purchases, promotion plays a substantial role in establishing brand-name presence foreign markets.
Most boxed or packaged chocolates are sold as gifts for special occasions.
With sales of $794 million in 2001, Elite Industries Ltd. is the domestic leader in Israel's chocolate and confectionery market.
Its confectionery product line includes chocolate bars, moulded and enrobed chocolate and chewing gum.
Carmit Candies, the Israeli distributor of Cadbury chocolates, is the country's leading manufacturer of marshmallows.
Although it has only a 4% share of the chocolate market, Carmit holds a 30% local market share of toffee candies, 21% of cookies, and 16% of halva.
Other major confectionery producers include A.K. International Age Marketing 1989 Ltd., Aharonoff Enterpresa Neve Zuf LTD., Allee Sweets (1990) Ltd., Friedland D. Ltd., Geva Food Products-Almond Tree, Mahroum Sweets Ltd., Rose of Galilee Candy & Chocolate Industry Ltd., Vita Quality Food Ltd., and Sides Moshe & Son Ltd.
Major domestic producers of chewing gum include Tamar Food Industries Ltd. and Atlas Sweets Ltd.
In 1999, chewing gum exports from Canada to Israel totalled $737 000.
Sugar confectionery exports, however, more than doubled in 2001 to $569 000, up from $226 000 in 2000.
Imports of chocolate confectionery products from Canada were negligible.
Israel's growing confectionery provides room for high-quality Canadian products.
Sugar-free and low-calorie confectionery products, in particular, are the fastest-growing market segments in this category.
Fish and Seafood In 2000, Israel's fish industry accounted for only 3.4% of the country's agricultural production.
The fish sector in Israel is limited to fresh-water fishing in the Sea of Galilee, salt-water fishing in the Mediterranean Sea and aquaculture facilities located in northern Israel.
Research is being conducted to determine if edible fish can be raised through thermal water sources in the south.
Future imports might decrease if this research proves successful.
In the mean time, the majority of fish and seafood consumed in Israel will be imported.
With sales of $16 million in 2000, canned tuna was the leading kosher fish product in the country.
Most tuna is imported but is packaged locally under the Bumblebee and Starkist brand names.
Imports of fresh lobster have been found recently in Israel's non-kosher market segment.
The best prospects for exporters include high-quality fish such as salmon and sole.
The United States, which accounted for 14% of country's $180-million fish imports in 2001, is Canada's main competitor in the market.
Canadian companies also face competition from Norway (salmon) and the Netherlands (herring).
Fresh or frozen fish is considered kosher if it has fins and scales.
Grains, Oilseeds and Pulses Israel relies on imports to meet 95% of its grains and oilseeds demand.
These thirsty crops are not commonly grown in Israel because of their heavy dependence on water.
Barley Barley is primarily used in Israel as a food supply for livestock.
It is also used as the basic ingredient for beer as well as an ingredient in soups and stews.
Local production of barley is concentrated in the Arab sector (mainly Bedouin in the Negev area) and to a lesser extent in the Jewish sector, where it is planted only for hay or silage.
In 2001, total domestic production amounted to 50 000 tonnes.
Due to the high price for barley, local production is expected to drop to 10 000 tonnes in 2002.
Imports of barley, most of which come from the Black Sea Basin (including Bulgaria and the Ukraine), showed a rising trend in the 1990s but dropped significantly in 2000 due to steep price increases.
Imports are forecast to rise again however in 2002 as local production is reduced.
The Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) holds a monopoly on Canadian malt barley sales to domestic and international customers.
Sales are made in two ways: the CWB works directly with customers to negotiate the purchase price and delivery conditions; and, secondly, accredited exporting companies purchase malt barley from the CWB for sales on their own accounts.
Exporters should note that most animal feeds and feedgrains do not require kosher certification.
Pulses Pulses, particularly chickpeas, dried beans and lentils, are an important part of the local diet.
Israel imported approximately 9000 tonnes of dry beans in 2001.
This figure is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 5.2% in 2002 and 2003; resulting in excellent opportunities for export sales of kidney beans, small white beans and great northern beans.
Israel's lentil imports have increased with an average annual growth rate of 8.82% over the last five years.
The country produces only 50 tonnes annually due to harsh climatic conditions.
Domestic demand and local production of chickpeas vary from year to year.
However, as a result of substantial investments, local production of chickpeas has been increasing steadily during the last 10 years, with an average growth rate of 13.7%.
Most chickpea suppliers to Israel are from the United States and the European Union.
However, new trade partners such as Turkey and countries from the former Soviet Union have also increased their share of the chickpea export market to Israel, through trimming costs due to proximity and cheap labour.
Israeli imports of dry peas will continue to be a strong market for Canada due to growing domestic consumption and the inability of local production to meet domestic demand.
Most Israeli pulse importers are small companies.
In many cases, importers are able to assume the responsibility of pulse distribution inside Israel.
Many of them are wholesalers and some of them have grocery outlets.
With sales of $5.1 million, pulses comprise the largest component of Canada's agri-food exports to Israel.
In 2001, lentils accounted for 19.8% of total exports.
Sales of beans (7.8%) and peas (5.3%) were also strong.
Canada is the top global supplier of lentils, peas and dried leguminous vegetables to the Israeli market and among the top four suppliers of chickpeas and beans.

More information about the CSCA and the services they provide can be obtained on their Web site at http://www.specialcrops.mb.ca.
Soybeans Due to water shortages, Israel's domestic oilseed production is limited to cottonseed, peanut and sunflower, which are grown mainly for feed or confectionery.
The country depends largely on imports of oilseeds for crushing.
In 2000, the United States accounted for 92% of soybean imports.
Water shortages may also result in the local industry foregoing production of sunflower seeds and peanuts in years to come, relying instead on imports for their needs.
Israel's annual crushing capacity of soybeans is approximately 625 tmt.
The largest soybean crusher in Israel is Shemen.
Other crushers include Teth-Beth, Olivex, Solbar and Milomor.
Domestic crushers are at a disadvantage because kosher restrictions allow them to operate only 250-270 days per year.
New crushing facilities in Turkey and Egypt are also posing a threat to domestic operations.
Although U.S. soybeans have a quality and supply advantage over many foreign suppliers, Israeli crushers are open to suppliers that can provide the same quality and reliability for service for a lower price.
Canadian exporters are therefore in a good position to compete.
Pet Food In Israel, approximately 21.5% of households have a dog, making them the most commonly owned pet in the country.
The number of dogs is also expected to rise in the coming years, increasing dog food sales.
Cats follow as the second-most popular house pet.
At present, approximately 12.2% of Israeli households having cats; this figure is expected to increase in the coming years as well.
Because of the unstable economy, sales of premium foods for dogs and cats will be low throughout the next few years, in favour of economy- and medium-priced foods.
Private-label pet foods, however, are expected to see significant growth.
Overall, wet dog food is expected to sell approximately $5 million in 2003, while dry dog food is expected to be worth $46 million.
Wet cat food is expected to sell $14 million and dry cat food is forecast to reach $18 million in 2003.
Sales of pet care products have been declining over the past few years from $11.3 million in 2000 to $10.6 million in 2001.
Forecasts estimate that sales in this sector will continue to decline for at least three years or until the economy becomes more stable and consumers are able to spend money on luxury items for their pets.
Sales of dog and cat food from Canada have almost doubled since 1998 reaching $1.4 million in 2001.
Canada is now the third-largest supplier to the Israeli market behind the United States ($9.1 million) and Italy ($1.8 million).
The market is poised for future growth and thus offers significant opportunities to Canadian companies.
Although non-kosher pet foods sell well in the market, kosher brands offer a distinct advantage and will likely provide a huge market in the future.
Prepared Foods/Packaged Foods Israeli consumers are looking for products that are quick and easy to prepare, and are spending more on food prepared away from home.
These changes in eating habits have encouraged supermarkets to allocate space for consumer-ready products, which consist of prepared meals and meal components.
Prepared foods also require certification--on a product by product basis, or at least on groups of raw materials.
According to the Kosher Meat and Poultry Imports Law, the meat or poultry component of prepared foods would have to come from an animal that had been slaughtered according to Rabbinate of Israel.
Exporters should consult with their potential importer or their agent in Israel prior to exporting.
Ready Meals Ready meals are aimed at consumers who work and do not have time to cook.
These meals are therefore convenient and easy to buy, transport, prepare and clean up.
Higher-earning professionals make up a large portion of ready-meal consumers.
Italian is the leading ethnic food in Israel as evidenced by the success of pasta-based ready meals and, most notably, pizza, which is the top-selling ready meal item in the country.
In 2000, frozen pizza accounted for 47% of volume sales and 44% of value sales in the ready meals category.
It is popular with all age groups and is purchased by families and singles.
Pizza, as well as poultry- and vegetable-based meals, sell for lower prices than red meat-, fish- and pasta-based ready meals because of the cost of their ingredients.
Although ready meals are available in several formats, chilled and frozen varieties are currently the best sellers and are poised for future growth.
Increased freezer space and the availability of new flavours have led to the growth of frozen ready meals.
Leading domestic producers of frozen ready meals include Soglowek Nahariya Ltd., Tivall, Tovav Ltd., Chiby Italian Food Ltd., Maadanot Ltd. and Hamsi Ltd.
Private-label ready meals have seen tremendous growth in recent years and accounted for 5.3% of total segment sales in 2000.
Nevertheless, sales of private-label ready meals are not slated for huge increases in the coming years due to the premium quality offered by their competitors.
There could be opportunities for high-quality, private-label ready meals, however.
The ready meals category is a relatively new area that has experienced strong growth in recent years due to busier consumer schedules.
As is the case with many new categories, currently there is a lack of brand loyalty, which will provide opportunities for high-quality products to distinguish themselves from existing brands.
Additional opportunities for Canadian suppliers may also be found in the sale of food ingredients used in the preparation of ready meals.
Condiments Israel's condiment market is valued at $210 million and is forecast to reach $225 million by 2005.
Ketchup has been the number one condiment since at least the mid-1990s and has retained the top spot since.
Tomato pastes, purees and sauces, salad dressings and mayonnaise offer consistent market growth, as do savoury sauces and dry mixes.
Osem, the leading domestic condiment producer, controls 50% of the market.
Other leading companies are Segal, Strauss and Vita.
Imported products account for 25% of the category and include popular brand names such as French's, Heinz, Hellmann's, La Choy and Paul Newman.
There is tremendous room for growth in this sector in a number of product categories, providing ample opportunities for Canadian exporters.
Ketchup is forecast to hold almost 25% of sales in 2003.
Tomato pastes and purees follow with a forecast of 17% while herbs and spices, as well as mayonnaise, are expected to represent almost 10% of sales.
Pickled products complete the top five condiments with almost 6% of sales.
Sales of Canadian condiments have fluctuated in recent years with exports of approximately $500 000 in 2001.
Snacks Annual consumption of savoury snacks in Israel is valued at $153 million.
Popular varieties include potato chips, wheat snacks, peanut snacks, and popcorn (particularly microwave popcorn), which have seen a 10-15% increase over the past few years.
Sales of snacks tend to increase by approximately 20-30% in the summer months.
Tremendous opportunities are available in the already booming savoury snack market.
Sales in 2002 are expected to reach $262 million, up from $256 million in 2001, and leap significantly to $278 million by 2005.
Israel's snack food industry is highly concentrated with two enterprises, Elite and Osem, dominating the market.
Nestlé, a majority owner of Israeli food producer Osem Investments, is scheduled to construct a research and development centre for snack foods in Sderot, Israel in 2002.
Spreads Although the spreads category makes up a small portion of Israel's total food and beverage sector, it has exhibited steady growth in recent years.
Chocolate spreads have seen the largest growth, from sales of $21 million in 1996 to $27 million in 2000.
It is the top overall product in the category, followed by honey and jams/preserves.
Demand for nut- and yeast-based spreads have also risen steadily in the past five years.
Continued growth in all categories is expected for at least the next four years with sales of $96.7 million forecast for 2005, up from $86.4 million in 2001.
Ingredients Opportunities for Canadian suppliers may also be found in the sale of food ingredients, since raw materials for Israel's food-processing sector are largely sourced through imports.
Agents actively seek out steady sources of supplies and are willing to pay higher prices for quality merchandise that is readily available.
Products including frozen fruits, ingredients for baked goods and ingredients for use in ready meals are in high demand.
Certain products that are sold in their natural state, such grains and oilseeds, can be certified as kosher even though they were not specifically produced as kosher product for Israel.
These products may require certification as to their kosher origin, but since the products do not go through a cooking process, the procedure is simpler than for prepared or processed products.
Nevertheless, exporters should check with their Israeli importer to ensure that all kosher requirements are met.
Private Label Private-label products represent an excellent opportunity for retailers to generate increased profits and distinguish themselves from competitors.
In 2001, private-label brands represented 7-9% of sales for the major supermarkets; this figure is expected to double in 2002.
With the growing demand for private-label goods in Israel, retailers are actively looking for new or unique products in nearly all product categories.
Super-Sol, Israel's leading supermarket chain, launched its private-label line, Super Class, in 2000 as a way to offer corporate branding to their products.
In 2001, the Blue Square supermarket chain entered into a partnership with Casino, the second-largest retailer in France, in an attempt to increase its market sales of private label from 4% to 10% of total store sales.
Under the agreement with Casino, Blue Square received a franchise for Casino's private-label line, Leader Price, which includes 2500 food and non-food products.
With its commitment to high quality and competitive pricing, the Canadian food industry is very well positioned to capture a larger share of this market.
The Clubmarket supermarket chain stocks President's Choice premium private-label products in addition to their own line, Cool.
Moreover, private-label lines offer important market access advantages, especially in markets so far away from home.
Categories with good prospects for Canadian companies include pet food, ready meals, confectionery and breakfast cereals.
Consumer patterns in the market are changing rapidly; annual per-capita consumption has increased over the past 10 years from 4 litres to 6.5 litres.
Approximately 79.4% of the adult Jewish population consumes wine.
Although most of the wine produced and consumed in Israel is kosher, the majority of imports are non-kosher wines.
For wine to be considered kosher it requires effort and commitment on the part of the wineries.
In general, only kosher vessels and materials may be used during the manufacturing process and the equipment and wine can only be handled by Observant Jewish males.
Importing wine to Israel is still sort of a niche activity, since the majority of supermarkets food chains and points-of-sale insist on the sale of kosher products only.
Nevertheless Canadian wines--particularly ice wines--are well-placed to develop a market share in Israel.
Additional opportunities can be found in sales of dry red wines, which are steadily reducing the dominance of white dry and semi-dry wines.
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT Local Capabilities Agriculture represents 2.5% of Israel's total gross domestic product and 3.6% of exports.
Israel grows approximately 95% of its food requirements; the remaining 5% comes from imports.
Israel's major crops include wheat, corn, fruit (apples, apricots, citrus, cherries, kiwis, guavas, pears, bananas, dates, mangoes, grapes and tomatoes), vegetables (avocados, cucumbers, peppers and zucchini) and field crops (spices, medicinal plants and groundnuts).
Locally grown poultry and eggs meet Israeli demand; poultry accounts for two thirds of all meat consumed.
Approximately 80% of Israel's domestically produced agriculture goods come from two types of co-operative agriculture settlements: the kibbutz, a collective entity based on co-operative principles; and the moshav, a village of family businesses in which each household earns money from their own products but work as a collective co-operative when purchasing and marketing products.
Non-co-operative villages comprise the remaining 20% of domestic production.
This group is made up of the Jewish sector (non-agricultural rural villages) and the Arab sector, which grow vegetables. fruit, and olives, as well as raise sheep and goats.
Israel has a large and sophisticated food-processing industry that provides a broad array of food products.
There are almost 2000 business engaged in some from of food processing.
The leading manufacturers include Tnuva Food Industries, Elite Industries Ltd., Osem, Strauss Dairies, Israel Edible Products (TAMI), Tivall and the Meir Ezra Group.
Israel's domestic food industry has shown a decline in net profits since 1999.
Sales of food products slipped 41% from 1999 to 2000 due to a decrease in exports and the loss of 500 jobs.
Hostilities have also been a factor in the industry's decline.
From October 2000 to June 2001, sales of Israeli food products to the Palestinian Authority have dropped 50%, totalling a loss of $76 million for Israeli food producers.
International Competition Israel has a liberal import policy and has entered into free trade agreements (FTAs) with several countries: the United States, the European Union, the European Free Trade Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Turkey and Mexico.
Canada's main competitors in Israel are the European Union, which accounted for 39% of total food imports in 2001, and the United States (24.4%).
The United States has traditionally maintained a strong presence in the Israeli agri-food market, having tariff advantages over some Canadian agri-food products.
Products recognized to be "American" do very well with consumers.
A number of multinational firms, including Nestlé (Osem-Nestlé), Unilever (Tami-Unilever), Pilsbury, Danone, Knorr, Heinz/Starkist, Proctor and Gamble, Del Monte, Cadbury Schweppes PLC, Yoplait, Coca Cola, PepsiCo and Best Foods, have successfully entered the market through licensing agreements or in partnership with local food producers.
Canadian Position Canadian agri-food products are well-positioned to thrive in the Israeli market.
A significant number of Canadian food manufacturers produce kosher food products including bakery products and ingredients, confectionery products, fish (especially salmon), soybean meal, honey, and packaged food products and meals.
Canadian food producers have also developed a reputation as dependable suppliers of private-label goods and have made significant inroads into the Israeli private-label market over the past few years.
Solid examples abound on the shelves of the Clubmarket, which sources a significant array of President's Choice (PC)-brand private-label products from Canada.
President's Choice brand pet food, for example, accounts for 8% of Israel's private-label sales and is leading PC-brand product line in the market.
Nevertheless trade between the two countries face a number of barriers in the form of quotas agreed upon in CIFTA.
However, these duty-free quotas have been set well above historical trade levels in the hopes of expanding agricultural trade, particularly in the areas of grains, oilseeds and pulses.
Competitive Advantage Through Canadian Government Policies and Initiatives Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation Canada and Israel are involved in a joint venture to promote research and development in all sectors including agriculture.
The Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation (CIIRDF) was established in 1993 to promote research and development co-operation between Canadian and Israeli firms.
The CIIRDF both promotes and provides grants for companies looking for joint ventures.
Export Development Canada Export Development Canada (EDC) offers export financing and insurance to Canadian exporters.
Additionally, insurance can be provided for larger transactions that are subject to the terms and conditions established by the buyer.
EDC prefers to work through letters of credit, bank credits or bank guarantees.
Approval for financing is considered on a case-by-case basis.
EDC has three facilities in Israel:
Bank Hapoalim ($15 million); Bank Leumi ($15 million); United Mizrachi Bank ($15 million).
Program for Export Market Development The Program for Export Market Development (PEMD) helps Canadian companies enter new markets by sharing the costs of activities that companies normally could not or would not undertake alone, thereby reducing risks involved in entering a foreign market.
The PEMD refundable contribution ranges from $5000 to a maximum of $50 000.
Preference is given to companies with fewer than 100 employees for a firm in the manufacturing sector and 50 in the service industry, or with annual sales between $250 000 and $10 million.
Other components of the program include international bid preparation (Capital Projects Bidding) and, for trade associations, developing international marketing activities for their membership.

MARKET LOGISTICS Israel's largest cities have well-developed transportation systems and are easily accessible from Israel's largest free ports:
Haifa and Ashdod on the Mediterranean Sea and Eilat, on the Red Sea (Gulf of Aqaba).
Eilat is home to the country's only free-trade zone.
All major ports offer good quality warehousing, including cold storage, but growing demand has rendered capacity problems.
Israel has 610 kilometres of standard gauge railway and 15 965 km of highways.
There are eight main airports located primarily in the largest cities.
Ben-Gurion International Airport is the largest.
Channels of Distribution With an estimated total value share of 67.6% by 2005, supermarkets, hypermarkets and co-operatives are expected to dominate Israel's retail food sector in the coming years.
The number of discount stores is expected to decline during this period and be replaced by outlets of leading supermarket and hypermarket chains.
Israel's leading supermarket chain is Super-Sol Ltd. which operates 143 stores throughout Israel.
The chain operates a variety of supermarket formats including Cosmos and Super-Sol, which are large urban supermarkets; Hyper-Netto, discount food stores; Seven Universe Club, club-member superstores; and Birkat Rachel, a discount chain of supermarkets specializing in kosher products for Israel's ultra-orthodox community.
SuperSol purchases most of its imports from Israeli importers but operates one central distribution centre from which they deliver products to various stores in the chain.
Super-Sol's major competitor is Blue Square Ltd., which operates 171 stores in Israel including 12 Mega hypermarket outlets.
Other retail formats run by the chain include Super Center, the company's discount supermarket chain; King Center, a smaller version of hard discount-format retail centres; SuperCenter City, neighbourhood stores based on the Super Center model, and Co-Op, medium-sized convenience stores (generally found in Tel Aviv).
Like Super-Sol's Birkat Rachel, Blue Square's Shefa Mehadrin chain also caters to Israel's ultra-orthodox population.
The chain purchases most of its imports from Israeli importers although some high-volume, high turnover items, which do not demand a long warehousing period, are imported directly.
With 160 stores, Clubmarket Ltd. is Israel's third-largest food chain.
Like its competitors, it operates several retail formats including Clubmarket, its flagship discount supermarket chain; Co-Op, a large chain of convenience stores; Hyperzol, chain of discount stores; Glatmarket, discount food stores targeted to ultra-orthodox consumers; Metro, mega-store specializing in discount wholesale trading; Rav Mecher discount retail stores; Jumbo, large hypermarkets, and Franchisees, a subchain of small neighborhood stores operated via franchisees.
On-line Sales In 2001, Blue Square launched its Blue Centre Home Buying Network, which allows customers to purchase food items via telephone, Internet or fax.
Clubmarket offers similar services to its customers.
These Web sites allow for 24-hour-a-day shopping and provides up-to-date information on all products available.
Clubmarket also produces a catalogue for shoppers who want to shop by telephone or fax.
Israel's main supermarket chains report increased on-line purchases in the past 12 months.
SuperSol's NetSal Online reported that on-line and telephone sales in 2002 for Passover grew 20-30% compared to the same period in 2001.
This is especially significant given that prices for food products sold over the Internet are priced higher than those purchased in shops.
It is believed that Internet-based sales have risen largely as a result of reluctance of people to shop in public places due to security concerns.
Importers, Agents and Distributors Good representation is the key to the Israeli market.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is well connected with key players.
For assistance in locating an agent or distributor, contact the Canadian Embassy in Israel.
Israel has a diverse import system, ranging from small, two to three person operations that contract out distribution to large companies that offer full marketing and logistic services.
Large international firms often use multiple importers for distribution, however.
A nationwide list of Israeli food importers is available from the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce.
Market-entry Considerations Suggested Business Practices The Consular Affairs Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's (DFAIT) provides country-specific travel information reports and advisories at www.voyage.gc.ca/destinations/menu_e.htm. Canadians travelling to Israel should pay particular attention to their security and follow news reports carefully, as the security situation can change rapidly.
When entering the Israeli market it is advisable to appoint a local agent who understands the local market.
There is an unspoken understanding and trust within Israel's business community that welcomes partners and sales, but looks for a local who "knows you."
Israeli consumers tend to focus on price, quality and brand recognition.
Israelis expect service; a product without service is a product without real potential.
Israel's two official languages are Hebrew and Arabic.
However, English is readily used, especially by the business community, and an increasing number of Israelis speak or read French.
Many other languages are also spoken.
On Saturday (Sabbath), businesses including most restaurants are closed.
However, Sunday is a regular work day.
Government offices and most companies are closed on Fridays.
Import Regulations The Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement was implemented on January 1, 1997.
The agreement improves market access for agri-food products of export interest to both Canada and Israel and eliminates virtually all tariffs on industrial goods.
It has partially restored Canada's competitive position in the Israeli market, where the United States and European Union have gained preferential access through negotiated bilateral agreements.
Canadian exports have increased by 30% since the CIFTA came into effect.
Canada and Israel are currently re-negotiating the CIFTA and Canada hopes to further liberalize trade in agri-food products.
Not only will this maintain Canadian exporter's competitive position vis-à-vis exports from other countries, it will help to secure long-term opportunities for Canadian agri-food products.
Canada and Israel agreed that the next round of negotiations would exclude the mutually sensitive supply managed sectors of dairy, eggs and poultry.
Through the CIFTA, duty-free access or low rates of duty for specific Canadian agri-food items have been made available:
• under the agreement, Israel has established annual duty-free tariff rate quotas of 200 000 tonnes of coarse grains (rye, barley, oats and corn) from Canada.
Canadian malt exports also benefit from duty-free tariff rate quotas with annual quotas set at 9000 tonnes;
•  Canadian producers of confectionery products, peanut butter, jams, fruit jellies, and sauces will also find duty-free access to the Israeli market;
•  pulse crops benefit from a duty-free tariff rate quota of 10 000 tonnes; and
• Canada also benefits from a preferential tariff-rate of 14% for frozen raspberries, blueberries and selected specialty berries.
For more information on the CIFTA, visit Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Web site at http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/ tna-nac/cifta-e.asp. With the exception of fresh fruits and vegetables, all imported products are subject to a value added tax of 17%, which is levied on the cost, insurance and freight, landed cost plus purchase tax.
Documentation Standard documentation includes a certificate of origin, a commercial invoice, a bill of lading and a kosher certificate.
Commercial invoices must contain the following information: names and address of supplier, seller and buyer; shipping information; detailed description of goods; quantity or measure (in metric units); price or value of each unit; total gross and net weights of each package; total gross and net weights of shipment; price per unit; terms of supply; rate of exchange; statement of all charges involved; total value of shipment; HS tariff number heading; country of origin; name of Israeli agent (if applicable); Israel import licence (if applicable); and signature of the manufacturer, consignor, owner or duty authorized agent.
With regard to health/phytosanitary certification, the Government of Israel requires that food and health products be registered with the Ministry of Health before they can be sold in the country.
Sanitary regulations are governed by mutual agreements under membership in the World Trade Organization.
Documents that need to be authenticated, such as certificates of sale and letters authorizing an exporter's local agent or importer to act on their behalf, must first be notarized in Canada.
At no cost to the exporter, the notarized documents can be authenticated by sending them to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's Authentication and Service of Documents (JLAC) branch.
Although import licences have been removed, imported food items still require the approval of the Ministry of Health's Food Inspection Service before entering the country.
This agency is also responsible for labelling and packaging requirements.
All plant material requires approval from the Plant Protection and Inspection Agency.
Fish imports must be accompanied by a Certificate of Origin and Hygiene.
Additional information on Canadian exports of fish to Israel can be obtained from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/fispoi/ export/cert10/isrisre.shtml). For statistical purposes, Canada requires exporters to complete an Export Declaration (Form B13A).
The following information is required on all consumer packaging entering Israel: country of origin; name and address of the producer; name and address of the Israeli importer; contents; and weight or volume in metric units.
In all instances, Hebrew must be used.
English lettering on the label may also be provided, but the English letters cannot be larger than the Hebrew letters.
Moreover, the English lettering must be identical in content to the Hebrew wording.
In the labelling, packaging and advertising of a food, section B.01.049 of the Food and Drug Regulations prohibits the use of the word kosher or any letter of the Hebrew alphabet, or any other word, expression, depiction, sign, symbol, mark, device or other representation that indicates or that is likely to create an impression that the food is kosher, if the food does not meet the requirements of the Kashrut applicable to it.
For more information, consult the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Web site at http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/bureau/labeti/guide/ 4-0-1be.shtml#4-2-16. All manufactured and processed foods must be labelled with nutritional information according to guidelines set by the Israeli health ministry.
Unprocessed fish is exempt from this requirement.
Exporters should consult with their importers for further details concerning Israeli labelling requirements.
The Israeli government has not yet issued a policy on genetically modified organisms.
However regulations are being prepared which will require positive labelling for genetically modified products or an ingredients.
To avoid infractions, exporters are strongly advised to consult with an Israeli authority to ensure all labelling and packaging requirements are met.
Specific information on labelling and packaging standards is available from the Israeli Ministry of Health, Food Control Services.
Local Standards, Certificates or Registrations Imported food products are subject to standards issued by the Standards Institution of Israel (SII) and the Ministry of Health's Food Control Services.
These standards include those for packaging and labelling of food products as well as technical specifications with respect to chemical and physical attributes.
The SII adheres to international standards established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
The SII is also the authority that determines wine standards in Israel.
The Wine Institute is in charge of their implementation and is therefore the only body in Israel legally responsible for the safe consumption by the general public of all alcoholic beverages, whether domestic or imported.
It is important to note that the Wine Institute is not considered an authority on the quality of the wine itself and is only judging whether the wine adheres to Israeli standards.
Export Credit Risks, Restrictions on Letters of Credit, Currency Controls Despite the security situation and political upheavals, conditions for financing in Israel remain favourable.
Payment is usually done through a letter of credit.
Credit terms last 60-90 days.
In cases where distribution arrangements are concluded, exporters are advised to prepare a contract detailing all major points of agreement, rights and responsibilities.
Local currency delays are, on average, one month.
Although local currency payments are generally made by importers within two weeks, foreign exchange delays of two months are currently reported.
The import cover is currently 5.8 months.

History  British Columbia Records indicate that early plantings of tree fruits in British Columbia followed in the wake of movement of settlers into the interior.
The earliest tree fruits are said to have been grown from seed brought to Fort Vancouver in 1826.
Scions or seedlings of tree fruits, supposedly taken from these early plantings, were then established for local use wherever settlements occurred.
By the 1850's, there were plantings of small orchards in the Lower Fraser Valley, and the first commercial orchard was said to have been established at Lytton, further north between 1870 and 1875 by Thomas G. Earl.
However, due mainly to cold winters, this area did not prove itself to be a particularly favourable region for orcharding.
In the meantime, an orchard established in 1867 in the Similkameen Valley by F.X. Richter did do well and from this beginning, the industry flourished.
The Okanagan, as well, was discovered to have a climate favourable to tree fruit production.
The first apple trees in the Okanagan Valley were plants by an oblate missionary, Father Pandosy, in 1862, on the present location of the City of Kelowna.
They were supposed to have orginated directly from trees planted at the Oblate Mission at Mission, B.C. When this first tree was planted, the area was semi-arid with insufficient rainfall to grow anything but sagebrush and rattlesnakes.
With the discovery that tree fruits did well in the hot dry climate of the Okanagan-Similkameen Valleys, fruit orchards sprang up throughout the area.
Obviously, many of these orchards did not survive due to unsuitable climate and/or soil conditions.
But with the introduction of power pumps and open flumes, which could be used to direct water from lakes and rushing creeks in the foothills, orchards were planted inland along the length of the Okanagan-Similkameen and Kootenay Valleys.
Now, 120 years later, with all of the modern methods for moving water not only inland but also to higher elevations, the slopes bordering these valleys have been planted to orchards and vineyards, and they now represent a veritable paradise on earth.
Ontario Fruit growing in Ontario probably commenced with the culture of cherries and peaches in the Niagara Peninsula.
Records indicate that these two fruits were being harvested at the mouth of the Niagara River as early as 1790.
Early mentions of apple propagation in the area come to us from the diary of Charles Woolverton of Grimsby Township.
He mentions that the sale of 200 acres of land to his grandfather, John Woolverton in 1796, was bound by the inclusion of 5 natural apple trees.
The first McIntosh tree was discovered in 1811 at Dundela, Dundas County, Ontario by John McIntosh, the son of Scottish immigrants to the United States.
He immigrated to Canada in 1796 from New York State, and eventually settled on a farm near Ottawa.
He discovered an overgrown orchard on this property and transplanted twenty of the healthiest seedlings to new ground, but only one survived.
This tree produced apples that all his neighbours commented on.
True to his Scottish origins, McIntosh tried to capitalize on his new find but it wasn't until 1835 when a peddler showed McIntosh techniques of bench grafting, that he succeeded in duplicating the famous McIntosh tree.
However, the McIntosh was slow to gain acceptance by growers probably due to its susceptibility to scab.
By 1900 with the new spray techniques becoming available to growers, McIntosh rapidly became an important variety.
Today, McIntosh are cultivated in nearly every apple growing area of North America.
Quebec Even before 1850 there were established orchards in several areas of Québec.
Most of the trees were seedlings grown from seeds supplied by such countries as United States, France, England and Russia, and a majority of these early orchards were located on the slopes of the mountainous region surrounding Farnham and Abbotsford.
Other important areas were located south of Montréal in Chateauguay County as well as west of Montréal in Deux Montagnes.
Other fruit growing areas found in the Isle of Orléans near Québec City and in L' Islet County further north, date back to the days of France's presence in Québec.
In 1875, 25,000 bushels of apples were harvested in Québec.
Of this crop a large percentage was marketed in Montréal.
M.B. Southwick of St. Hilaire reported 20,400 apple trees in that area in 1876.
An equivalent number was reported in the Abbotsford region.
Much of the harvest was marketed in populated centres on the shores of the St. Lawrence.
Today that same marketing pattern exists with a large majority of the Québec crop moving to major urban centres such as Montréal and Québec City which border the St. Lawrence River.
New Brunswick Fruit cultivation was probably introduced to New Brunswick in the 17th century by early settlers from France who came out to settle Acadia.
Nicholas Denys was one of these.
He and his wife came to the New World to manage a string of fur-trading posts in Northern Acadia.
Denys was also expected to bring out colonists.
Unfortunately, he had difficulties doing this and as a result, he was dispossessed and lost most of his belongings.
He finally retired with his wife and family to a small farm which he owned near Nipisiquit, New Brunswick.
Here, he kept a garden with fruit trees in it.
He left journals and information on fruit propagation in the area which provided important information for others in the fruit industry to build on.
New York State still supplied apples to Fredericton as late as 1856.
However, the greatest advances in fruit cultivation in the province after this date must be attributed to Frances Peabody Sharp of Upper Woodstock.
By 1891, he was reported to be growing 900,000 apple trees and 60,000 plum trees, and was shipping nursery stock all over the continent.
Sharpe was also very interested in apple breeding and developed two varieties, the New Brunswick Apple and Crimson Beauty, which apparently had the Fameuse and the New Brunswick Apple as its parents.
Today, the Crimson Beauty is still grown in many Canadian orchards and stands as a monument to one of Canada's early horticulturists.
Nova Scotia As with the development of fruit culture in other parts of Eastern Canada, fruit growing no doubt was introduced to the area by early settlers and was necessitated by the need for self-sufficiency.
That would date the beginning of fruit propagation in Nova Scotia to the early 1600's.
As with Québec, fruit growing was a family affair with each homestead having several apple trees.
In 1862, displays of Nova Scotia fruit at a London, England exhibition were widely acclaimed by all who saw them.
By 1939, Nova Scotia was exporting 75% of its production to the British markets.
However, from 1939 to 1965, the industry exports to U.K. went into a decline.
Three things possibly caused this.
As was the case during World War I, little fruit was exported to the U.K. during the second World War.
By the time the war was over, fruit production and specifically apple production in England and Europe had reached significant proportions.
Coupled with this was the shortage of exchange.
The organization of the European Economic Community, and Britain's entry into it, did little to improve the status of Nova Scotia in a traditional market.
The introduction of several processing facilities which take a large percentage of the crop has somewhat served to temper the blow that the industry suffered in losing this market, and together with added interest in the potential of apples for processing, has served as an incentive for increasing interest in fruit production in the province.
Welcome to Canadian Apple Online, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's site for Canadian apple market information Agri-Food Trade Service Online provides access to international trade and market information for Canadian agri-food exporters.
Canadian Apple Online will be helpful to a large base community to better understand the dynamics of the apple industry in Canada.
On this site, you will find basic information on production, trade, regulation and even nutrition.
More detailed information could be accessed through other links.
From this site, you can also access a series of contacts from governments, industry and the main national and regional associations.

Production  Canadian Fruit Situation The summer of 2002 was characterized as being generally dry in nearly all regions of the country.
These conditions had the effect of reducing production of most fruit crops including apples, tender fruits, raspberries and strawberries.
The resulting lower production also negatively affected farm gate values.
In 2002, the value of all Canadian fruit, including apples, tree fruit and berries, amounted to $517.1 million, a small decrease of less than 1% from 2001.
Within the overall fruit category, the berry sector accounted for the largest percentage of value with 54.5%, followed by apples with 31.2%, and tree fruits with 14.1%.
The area of production of berry and tree fruits changed (Table 1) over the past twenty years with the help of new technology and pruning practices that have allowed producers to increase tree densities, yields and therefore production.
Over the last five years, the number of tree fruit farms have decreased by 28%, after being relatively stable fifteen years before.
On the other hand, the number of berry farms have slightly decreased, but by only 2% the last five years.
The important changes were in acreage.
Berry farms increased their acreage by more than 20% the last five years and more than doubled the last twenty years.
The berry category (blueberries and cranberries) have witnessed increased production in response to positive health claims, but prices have weakened in the past few years due to oversupply situations and weaker export opportunities.
Grape area continues to expand and has increased over 40% in the last five years, driven primarily by the demand for high quality Vinifera grapes for wine production.
In the 2001 Statistics Canada Census, from 1996 to 2001, number of acreage devoted to apple production decreased by 18% mainly due to low commodity prices and retail consolidation, and in spite of new production practices and better yield per hectare.
Producers are struggling to receive a fair return of their crop.
Being at the end of the supply chain, producers want to remain competitive and achieve the goals of environmentally responsible production of safe, high quality food for domestic and exports markets.
Table 1 - Number of Farms and Hectares (Tree Fruits and Berries) by major provinces PROVI NCES 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2001/ 19961
Statistics Canada (1981 to 2001 Census) 1 % Change from 2001 to 1996
Apples The 2002 Canadian apple crop is estimated at 412,161 metric tonnes (MT) representing a 15% drop from 2001 (482,484 MT) and the fourth consecutive decrease since 1999 (see Table 2).
The provinces of Ontario and Quebec suffered huge loss with record-low production over the last five years.
Climate conditions and severe competition form other countries are responsible for those decreases.
The farm gate value of Canadian apples from the 2002 crop are estimated at $166 million, nearly the same as in 2001 ($166.3 million) and almost as low as the 1998 crop ($160 million).
On a provincial basis, production in British Columbia decreased slightly by 2% from a year earlier to reach 126,600 MT, and remained relatively stable at that level since the 1998 crop.
McIntosh, Spartan, Red Delicious, IdaRed and Empire are the major varieties produced mostly in Eastern Canada.
British Columbia growers have planted a number of newer apple varieties such as Gala, Fuji, Braeburn, Jonagold, Ambrosia and Honeycrisp.
In fact, Gala should become the most important variety in BC, before Red Delicious.
New plantings of Ambrosia are doubling in size every year and should remain likewise for the next 3-4 years.
In response to rising availability, grower prices for these newer varieties has moderated significantly in the past couple of years.
In addition, apples continue to compete for limited retail shelf space with other major fruit such as bananas and citrus, but also more increasingly from exotic fruits from around the world which are now available on a year-round basis.
Apple juice concentrates from China were imported at a very low price and affected greatly local industry and growers.
Producers had to find alternate options to process their apples.
Ontario had to increase the number bulk loads of apples from Maritime provinces.
Ambrosia is also popular in Ontario and plantings are expected to increase.
New-Brunswick and Nova Scotia recorded major increase in production, improving their trade with central provinces.
Statistics Canada * Estimate 1 % Change from 2002 to 2001
1.1 Cost of production As the Canadian Apple industry is a major component of the horticulture industry, many producers are afflicted with low returns on investment, even below their costs of production.
Producers claim to loose 22.85 cents per kg (9.25 cents per pound) on average, surviving mostly on depreciation and equity of their assets.
Replant costs are estimated $30,000 to $37,000 per hectare ($12,000 to $15,000 per acre) and full production capacity is not reached until 4 to 6 years following replant.
There is also support from Farm Credit Canada with their program "Plant Now - Pay Later" allowing up to three years of interest deferral.
1.2 Storage Holdings & Utilization With respect to the 2002 crop, total storage holdings as of November 01, 2002 (the first storage release date of the new crop year) were 201,199 MT, a 5.5% decrease from the 213,013 MT in storage the previous year at the same time.
Only the province of Quebec recorded an increase while other major provinces recorded decreases varying from 2% to 27% (see Table 3).

1.3 Standard Practices 1.3.1 Integrated Fruit Production In March 2002, the Canadian Horticultural Council received approval for up to $151,500 in CARD funding on December 19, 2001 from the Canadian Adaptation and Rural Development (CARD) fund for "The Canadian Apple Industry National Integrated Fruit Production (IFP) Initiative".
IFP is defined as the economical production of high quality fruit which gives priority to ecologically sound methods, and minimizes the use of agricultural chemicals, thereby protecting the environment and human health.
The project is designed to develop national IFP guidelines, principles and standards for the Canadian apple industry.
More information is available on the CHC website at (http://www.hortcouncil.ca/). The CHC's Apple Working Group (AWG) will move into the next phase of the initiative and works towards deelopment of national on-farm food safety guidelines for Canadian apple growers.
1.3.2 Integrated Pest Management The apple industry, in cooperation with Provincial extension specialists and officials at the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA), have developed an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy.
IPM is a process that optimizes the use of biological, cultural and chemical measures to control pest and disease pressures.
Producers continue to adapt their agricultural management practices to respond to environmental concerns, reduce costs of crop protection materials and address pest/disease resistance concerns.
The framework for the program has also been designed to be transferable to other tree fruit crops.
IPM is part of the IFP strategy.
1.3.3 Pest Management Regulatory Agency - Update Update on Streptomycin and 1-MCP Apple growers' concerns in relation to product availability in the short term include the antimicrobial Streptomycin, and a growth regulator type of product recently registered in the U.S., 1-MCP (1-methylcyclopropene).
The bacterial disease fire blight can affect several types of fruit trees including apple and pear.
Under favourable conditions and without adequate control, a fire blight infection can have a serious impact in an orchard.
One of the few tools available to apple growers for managing this problem is the antibacterial Streptomycin.
The issue of antibiotic resistance in general, and the fact that resistance problems have been observed in some orchards have been making the future of this product uncertain.
However, growers are not ready to give up on the use of this product since no other alternatives have been found yet to fill the niche of an efficient antibacterial product for orchard use.
Registration of this product has been renewed for the 2003 season.
When harvested fruits are exposed to the volatile active ingredient 1-MCP, they are less susceptible to the influence of the gaseous plant hormone ethylene, which is involved in the ripening of fruit.
Ethylene is particularly important in stored apples and that is why apple growers see the new product as having good potential to improve the quality of their produce and to extend apple storage time.
They are eager to obtain early registration of this product since their US counterparts already have the benefit of using 1-MCP since last year.
The product 1-MCP has entered the submission process at the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, following a recent application for registration in Canada.
1.3.4 Traceability (www.producesupply.com) Traceability addresses how a product can be traced through the supply chain.
CPMA and PMA created in November 2002 a joint task force to tackle traceability (CPMA/PMA Traceability Task Force).
This group is to produce a "best practices" document that will serve as a road map for the industry for implementing traceability.
More information on EAN available at: http://www.ean-int.org/index800.html. 1.3.5 Canadian Partner-in-Quality A Quality Management program based on HACCP principles, the Canadian Partners in Quality (C-PIQ) program, is being developed as a voluntary alternative to traditional inspection methods for fresh fruit and vegetables.
Under the C-PIQ program, the facility would assume responsibility for documenting and implementing a Quality System to ensure that produce quality requirements are met.
The program will be validated through periodic audits of each facility's system by CFIA auditors.
The initial C-PIQ pilot project, in 2002, in potato packing facilities in the Atlantic went well.
CFIA have had discussions with the industry on fees and presented the program to the USDA last summer.
USDA visited the pilot participants and CFIA is awaiting USDA acceptance of the program.
1.3.6 Code of Practice for unpasteurized fruit juice A voluntary "Code of Practice" for the manufacture of unpasteurized fruit juice/cider, developed by the CFIA in partnership with Health Canada, producer, processor, distributor and consumer representatives was finalized and distributed in 1998.
The Code sets out recommendations for growing, harvesting, transporting, storing, processing, packaging, and distributing the product.
Its objective is to make all producers aware of the potential problem and inform them of how to avoid the contamination of their juice/cider by pathogenic microorganisms, such as E. coli 0157:H7.
1.3.7 Global Coding To ensure consistency of codes around the world, industry worked with the International Federation for Produce Coding (IFPC) to introduce a global standard for the use of international Price Look-Up (PLU) numbers.
Those numbers are available free on the internet at: www.plucodes.com. 1.3.8 Data Pools The emergence of data pools in the industry is present in Canada (ECCnet) and the United States (UCCnet).
Launched in 2000 by the Electronic Commerce Council of Canada (ECCC), ECCnet is designed to centralize data to ensure greater accuracy and also provide cost-savings to trading partners.
The Canadian produce industry has come up with its own Industry Product Database (IPD), the purpose of which is the same as EECnet, but structured to meet the specific requirements of produce.
The industry is now trying to determine which system is going to provide the best solution, the best data and the easiest to manage.
1.3.9 Repacking, Transportation and Wholesale Food Safety Project The first edition of these "best practices" guidelines will be finalized in 2003 by CPMA.
Also CPMA will issue a HACCP model for the repacking and wholesale sector, including Critical Control Points.
The model may not apply to all as needs differ.
CPMA involved the Canadian Council of Grocery Distributor (CCGD) in developing and implementing a HACCP toolkit for the warehouse operations.
1.3.10 Promotion Canada's apple producers supported a national apple promotion in the past two years in conjunction with the Five to Ten A Day campaign.
In addition, a national apple website was initiated in the summer of 2000 and can be accessed at: http://ats-sea.agr.ca/applecanada/. The site includes such subjects as production areas, associations, suppliers, varieties and consumer information.
1.4 Trade As of January 1st, 2003, the Mexican government implemented the 2003 tariff elimination on agri-food products as scheduled under NAFTA.
Fresh apples, grape and apple juice have now duty free access in the Mexican market.
During the 2001-02 CY, Canadian imports (quantity) of fresh apples surpassed exports by 113%.
In the 1996-1997 CY, imports were almost the same volume as exports.
GRAPH -- Imports and Exports of Fresh Apples (quantity) GRAPH -- Imports and Exports of Fresh Apples (value) 1.4.1 Exports The volume of Canadian fresh apple exports for the first five months (August - December) of the 2002-03 crop year (CY) were up 12% to 35,306 MT as compared to 31,438 MT in the 2001-02 CY for the same period (Table 4).
The value of exports for the first five months of the 2002-03 CY increased 23% to $34.9 million from last year's period ($28.3 million).
For the first five months of 2002-03 CY, exports to the U.S. and Mexico were almost unchanged from last year's period.
Total Canadian apple exports were valued at $52.1 million for the 2001-02 CY, virtually the same as the previous CY and 22% below the record-high 1996-1997 season.
During the past ten crop years, 65% to 70% of all Canadian apple exports originated from British Columbia, while providing between 25% and 30% of total production.
Compared to domestic production, exports of apples represent approximately 10% to15% of total production.
Statistics Canada *August to December 2002 1 % Change from 2001-02 to 2000-2001 Canada has exported apples to over 20 countries (see Table 5) in the past few years with the most commonly exported varieties being Golden and Red Delicious and Gala.
The United States, Mexico and the United Kingdom remain in the top three, other countries in Asia-Pacific and the Caribbean have been moving in and out of the remaining spots.
Canada should gain market share in Mexico with the latest improvements in NAFTA.
In Europe, Canada exports mainly to the United Kingdom.
As for Asia, the value of Canadian exports has fluctuated widely in recent years due to the downturn of the Asian economy.
During the first five months of 2002-2003, exports to the Philippines and Indonesia appear to be declining compared to the previous year.
In the past few years, low priced Chinese apples have displaced Canadian apples from many Asia-Pacific markets.
Statistics Canada *August to December 2002 1 % Change from 2001-02 to 2000-2001 1.4.2 Imports The volume of Canadian fresh apple imports for the first five months (August - December) of the 2002-2003 crop year (CY) were up 39% at 41,368 MT as compared to 29,840 MT in the 2001-02 CY for the same period (Table 6).
However, the import value for the first five months of the 2002-03 CY increased by 54%, from $33.2 to $51.0 million.
Canada imports of fresh apples originated from about 15 countries, lead by the U.S., New Zealand, South Africa, Chile and Argentina (Table 7).
The following apple varieties accounted for most of Canadian imports:
Granny Smith, Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, and to a lesser extent Fuji, Gala, Braeburn and McIntosh.
The main time period for apple imports from Southern Hemisphere countries is April through August, with June having the largest number of imports.
1.4.3 Imports of Fresh Apples for Processing The total quantity of fresh apples imported for processing in 2001 amounted to 33,915 MT, a decrease of 15% from 2000.
The 2001 imports were valued at $38 million, down 15% from the previous year.
(A reminder that these statistics are based on calendar year and not crop year).

1.5 Other Markets 1.5.1 U.S. Apple Situation Utilized apple production for 2002 is estimated at 3,898 thousand MT (8.47 billion pounds), down 8 percent from the 2001 level, and down for the third consecutive year.
Decreased acreage was caused mainly by financial problems and fierce competition from foreign apple growers, namely China.
Washington's utilized production increased 5 percent compared to the weather reduced 2001 crop.
California, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania decreased total utilized production from the previous year due to poor weather and less bearing acreage.
Higher prices for apples and pears were mainly responsible for the 3-percent increase in the U.S. grower price index for fruit and nuts during the fall of 2002 compared with the previous year.
Weather problems such as freezing temperatures and hail reduced the harvest of apples and pears this past fall and together with lower stocks drove grower prices higher for these two commodities.
Fresh apple prices averaged 17 percent higher.
Aside from significant declines in production among eastern and central apple-producing States, a late October freeze in Washington, the Nation's largest producer of apples, has further reduced domestic supplies available for marketing into 2003, particularly of the Pink Lady and Fuji varieties.
Hence, apple prices are expected to remain strong and increase further through this winter, especially as supplies grow seasonally tighter.
As of December 1, 2002, fresh apple holdings in regular and controlled atmosphere storage facilities, as reported by the U.S. Apple Association, were down 2 percent from the same period the year before and are the lowest level in more than a decade.
National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA f = forecast 1 % Change 2003 from 2002 1.5.2 U.S. Apple Trade Apples lead in U.S. fresh fruit exports, both in volume and value terms.
Each year the United States ships more than 500,000 MT (1.1 billion pounds) of apples to markets across the world, with an annual value of approximately over $360 million.
The quantity of fresh apples shipped between January and November 2002 declined 18 percent over the previous year along with its value, from $363.9 to $329.2 million.
1.5.3 World Market For the second consecutive year, China and the U.S., the two leading world apple producers, have witnessed decrease of apple acreage.
In China, government policy encouraged fruit growers to more fruit diversification, contributing to reducing the apple acreage.
In terms of the variety mix, there is indication that the importance of Red and Golden Delicious will slowly decrease at the expense of Gala and Fuji.
Market globalization and increasing competition require good knowledge of the competitive strengths and weaknesses of different producing countries.
It is also important to monitor trends in consumer preferences in order to plan a future strategy for production, distribution and marketing.
Newer varieties that entered the apple market in the 1990's have become so mainstream that their once attractive price premiums have leveled off.
The Canadian apple industry has been facing a number of challenges over the past decade or so, including a general decline in producer prices and an increase in North American and world production (see Table 9).
Canada must remain competitive in order to survive not only at home but also in foreign markets.
Apples are produced in all major parts of the world and retailers can supply from all those sources, as long as those apples meet certain requirements.
Many of those requirements are dictated by consumers and competition.
In Canada, consumers have a considerable advantage compared to others around the world as they spend less than 10% of their income on a food basket.
Competition is then fierce.
Canadian producers must then differentiate from other suppliers with unique advantages.
Canada produces approximately 500,000 MT of apples each year, or less than 1% of the world production estimated at 59,000,000 MT in 2001 (Table 9A).
Two regions, Asia and the European Union are the main producers (Table 9B).
China's apple production increased by five-fold in the last decade alone to more than 20 million MT.
Varieties of apples have also changed since the early 1990's.
This increase was at the expense of varieties such as Red and Golden Delicious, Rome and McIntosh, that are predominant in Canada.
Production is expected to rise by 21% in the world, mostly because of China, until 2010.
Canada has increased its imports of apple juice concentrate from China and fresh apple imports from countries such as New Zealand, South Africa and Chile.
FAO Statistics 1 United States and Canada only 2 Consult FAO definitions * % change 2001 over 2000 The sector is in the process of addressing issues such as market development, research and reduced pesticide usage, all of which will benefit producers.
As an example, tariffs for the European Community (EC) are very complex, changing every month during the European Union (EU) crop season and differing for each apple variety.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), TRQ and tariffs for apples for Mexico were eliminated in January 2003.
Tariffs in Argentina are 13% and Venezuela 15%.
In addition to these tariffs, there can be consumer and other taxes which vary from 3% to 15%.
In Asia, there are tariffs of 50% in Taiwan, 10% in Thailand and 5% in Indonesia.
Japan still requires apple exports to be fumigated and an inspector to be on site during the fumigation.
1.6 Challenges Producers will face major challenges in the next decade and these originate from the consumers themselves, social pressures and the retailers.
Consumption of apples was a family thing, with the typical father-mother-two-kids model.
Things have moved from a more single parent and single-person model.
Consumers are also more educated and conscious of their environment and the way food is produced or processed.
They want to know more about pesticides, food additives and the nutrition value of the food they buy.
As people are more educated and informed about what they eat, they in turn want more convenient, prepared and ready-to-eat food.
Snacking have become increasingly present for those consumers.
For more than half of century, retail consolidation and the impact of fast-food chains and major discounters such as Wal-Mart or Costco have increased price pressure on growers and changed the consumer habits for good.
Retailers favourised their own private labels at the expense of the manufacturer's brands.
Retailers also want some insurance from suppliers that not only the product is of high quality but also safe and traceable.
Category management have become very popular and efficient for both buyers and suppliers.
To remain competitive, the produce industry may have to have to diversify not only in production (new varieties) but also in new marketing techniques (new markets, new products, processed products).
Consumption Over the last 10 years, the consumption of fruit (fresh only) remained relatively unchanged going from 62.18 kg per capita (KPC) in 1992 to 63.42 KPC in 2001.
With people becoming increasingly more health conscious, consumption went from fresh to processed and more "convenience" fruits (juices, processed and frozen).
Continued improvements in packaging, transportation and distribution have all contributed to the increase in per capita consumption of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables.
The two most favorite fresh fruit of Canadians are citrus and bananas (Table 18).
Apples are next.
Statistics Canada 1 % Change from 2001 to 2000
Opportunities or Challenges $ Liberalization of trade under the WTO should help Canadian exporters to continue to develop offshore markets.
$ Canada's shorter growing season reduces opportunities for market expansion into offshore markets.
Strong competition from earlier maturing U.S. crops tends to set the price and generally impacts negatively on growth opportunities.
$ Implementation of the new IFP guidelines should increase consumer confidence and industry acceptance in Canada and abroad.
IFP guidelines were developed on the basis of international systems such as Europe's EUREPGAP.
$ Favorable media reports on the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables will continue to encourage future sales.
$ With practically no use of pesticides or chemical fertilizers during production, the wild blueberry production can be considered as "organic" and benefit from higher prices.
$ Future berry production is expected to increase, driven by a good demand from secondary processors such as bakeries for use in muffins, bagels, pies and the dairy sector for use by yogurt manufacturers.
$ Increased competition from Chinese fresh apples in Asian markets is expected to increase in coming years and will exert downward pressure on prices.
$ Continued favorable exchange rates should help Canadian exporters maintain market share in foreign markets.
$ Consolidation in the retail food sector and the increased popularity of large warehouse superstores are forcing producers, packers and distributors to reassess their marketing strategies.

Storage  History of Storage of Apples Storage of apples may have had its beginnings with the custom of burying barrels of apples in the ground, and covering them with soil and trash.
However crude this method was, it was probably the initial step in storage development, and without doubt, led to on-farm root cellars as a more sophisticated method of fruit storage.
Although with either of these methods, temperature could not be controlled, it usually tended to be constant at somewhere above freezing and was suitable for at least delaying, if not preventing, deterioration of the product stored.
On-farm root cellars, however primitive compared to today's cold storages, are still an effective means of storing perishable products, if the product is of a reasonable quality beforehand.
They have also helped to identify the need for better storage techniques.
In 1920, Canada got into the cold storage research business also, with research programs in storage being initiated at both Summerland, British Columbia, and Kentville, Nova Scotia.
In 1929, the first experimental cold storages were built, one at Summerland, British Columbia, and one at the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa.
Cold storage apples are chilled to 0ºC in special chambers.
Since apples continue to live after picking, and breathe by using oxygen and giving off carbon dioxide, maintenance of the apples at a low temperature slows the respiration and thus retards the ripening process.
The humidity is also controlled.
Maintenance at around 85%, or higher, prevents loss of moisture by evaporation.
By the 1950's, research in a new storage technique called controlled atmosphere storage, had gained widespread interest.
Interestingly enough, controlled atmosphere storage techniques had been examined by several scientists previous to this, as early as the 1820's in fact, but unfortunately for the industry, all this work had gone unnoted or unused.
This new technique combined airtight refrigeration at 0ºC with an atmosphere reduced in oxygen, and with increased levels of carbon dioxide.
The resulting effect was that the ripening process slowed to a rate such that the apples could be maintained longer than under normal cold storage.
The first commercial C.A. storage was constructed at Frelighsburg, Québec in 1953.
Of vital importance to the storage of apples under these conditions, are two things: the apples must be of excellent quality, and the storage should be closed and sealed as quickly as possible after initial filling begins, to achieve the maximum benefits of the technique.
C.A. storages are closed under government supervision and must not be opened for at least 90 days after a seal is affixed, for the apples to be officially called C.A. apples.
With the development of cold storage, apples could be marketed for extended periods of time.
The implications of this technique on the industry were immediate and positive.
Instead of trying to market all his apples during a two month span in the fall, the producer was now able to sell "fresh" apples up until Christmas.
With the introduction of Controlled Atmosphere storage, the marketing season was extended until March and April, with further benefits to both growers and consumers.
The sale of the product over a longer period of time, resulted in a more even price distribution over the marketing season.
The consumer was able to buy "fresh" Canadian apples during many of the winter months previously bereft of local apples.
A further modification of the controlled atmosphere storage concept, simply called low oxygen storage, has been researched in recent years.
Canada is a world leader in the research work presently being conducted on the controlled atmosphere storage concept.
Few commercial enterprises have attempted this new storage method because of its increased complexity and cost.
Although the monetary benefits can be easily measured, and opportunities for sales of apples in the summer months are identified, the technique is still in research stages.
Apples can be stored by the low oxygen technique in chambers used for controlled atmosphere storage, but the gases in the chamber must be much more closely monitored under low oxygen storage.
The equipment needed to do this is also more highly specialized.
Three things are vital when considering low oxygen storage: one must be knowledgeable about the subject and prepared to spend both extra time and money on the project; the apples which go into such a storage must be of the highest quality and of specific maturity; and the apples must be chilled to the appropriate temperature and atmosphere mix as quickly as possible after harvest.
These three factors cannot guarantee success but can increase the likelihood that the project would reach a positive conclusion.
Present Storage Situation Canadian apple storage holdings by type of storage, by region of storage and by variety of apples show that developments in storage have followed the needs of the industry.
The volume of apples held in C.A. storage has been gradually increasing over the years.
As more C.A. storages are built, more and more apples are being held for extended periods.
Apple storage data is collected monthly, October to July, in each province across Canada and reports are made available to the public by the second week of that month through the web site at http://www.agr.ca/infohort/. Reports available are:
Apple Storage by Type, Province and District  Provides data by provincial district and storage type (Controlled Atmosphere, Cold and Common).
Apple Storage by Type, Variety and Utilization  Provides data by provincial district and intended utilization (Fresh, Juice and Peeler)
Summary The availability of C.A. storage at a commercial level, has greatly extended the marketing season for apples.
Excellent C.A. apples now appear on supermarket shelves as late as July.
Of course, it is not economic for a grower to store all his apples in C.A. storage.
The ideal situation is to have a combination of cold and controlled atmosphere storages.

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Indonesia December 2006
Table of Contents
Indonesia Country Report:
Overview Indonesia is located in Southeast Asia and is the world’s largest archipelago composed of more than 17,000 islands bordering Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Malaysia.
Java island, the most populous island in the world, is home to over half of Indonesia’s total population.
The island is also home to Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital and largest city, with an approximate population of 8.8 million.
Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population of approximately 205 million.
Globally, Indonesia is perceived as an emerging market which has recovered from a number of past economic shocks and is making positive political and economic developments.
Economic growth is expected to continue due to a prominent agriculture sector, developing industry sector, and expanding services sector.
The country is also a strong international exporter and maintains a positive agricultural trade surplus.
Indonesia is a rapidly expanding market for Canadian agri-food and seafood exports, with Canadian exports to Indonesia growing a substantial 114% more than Indonesia’s worldwide imports, from 2003 to 2005.
The Indonesian consumer market is maturing, incomes are rising, and lifestyles are becoming increasingly busy.
Eating out is on the rise, and consumers are increasingly seeking functional food and beverages.
Healthy lifestyle and diet awareness and knowledge is slowly growing and making an impact on consumer eating and spending habits.
Canada - Indonesia Relations Canada and Indonesia have a long history of co-operation on a wide range of issues such as education, social equity projects, trade agreements, and initiatives to support reform and governance.
Diplomatic relations have existed between the two countries for over 50 years.
Canada and Indonesia also share membership in a number of international organizations, most notably APEC, IMF, IMO, OPEC, UN, and WTO.
Canada’s investment presence in Indonesia is quite strong, with Canadian foreign direct investment valued at $3.5 billion in 2004.
Canada-Indonesia relations are considerably influenced by participation in APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation).
APEC is composed of 21 members, many being located in the Asia-Pacific region, but also a number of countries located around the world, including Canada and the United States (U.S.). APEC’s purpose is to foster Asia-Pacific economic growth, freeing trade and investment, and to reinforce the strength of the regional community.
For more information on APEC and Canada-APEC relations visit the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada web site at http://www.asiapacific.ca . APEC’s web site can be found at http://www.apec.org .
Canada- Indonesia Ag Trade Exports (2005) Imports (2005) Trade balance (2005) $204.2 million $207.9 million ($3.7 million)
Indonesia’s Canadian product imports increased 18% from 2004 to 2005, and processed food products rank as the third most opportunistic Canadian export market to Indonesia.
The majority of Canadian agricultural exports to Indonesia are cereals.

Animal feed was the second largest import at 15.2% ($1 billion), followed by sugars and sugar confectionary which accounted for 12.1% ($795.8 million).
Indonesia imports an approximate 1.5 million tonnes of sugar in order to supply a domestic sugar demand of 3 million tonnes.
In 2005, bulk and cereal grains composed 79% of Canada’s agri-food and seafood exports to Indonesia and have historically held a similar position.
Canada’s Top 5 Agricultural Exports to Indonesia (2005) Wheat, non-durum Soybeans Malt extract Animal Feed Frozen fries $157.5 million $12.4 million $9.3 million $5.9 million $5.0 million

However, the majority of Indonesia’s population is opposed to these reforms.
Consumption is expected to continue to drive economic growth in 2006 and economic recovery is projected to continue in the future.
A number of developments are providing positive markers for Indonesia’s economic future.
2004 Tsunami relief efforts have been successful and there has been considerable cooperation among the government, armed forces, and aid workers.
Indonesia is no longer included on the OECD Financial Action Task Force’s list of uncooperative countries.
A major peace process has also begun with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, which has ended a 29 year political conflict between the government and the Free Aceh Movement in the province of Aceh.
Current:
• GDP in 2005 was comprised of GDP US$281.3 billion agriculture (13.4%), industry (45.8%), and services (40.8%).
• All major Indonesian sectors have GDP/capita US$ 1, 256 a key role in the economy.
Agriculture has historically been a GDP/capita (PPP) $4, 364 dominant sector, however the services sector is growing and the mining and manufacturing sectors play a prominent part in the economy.
• Major natural resources are oil, natural gas, tin, bauxite, copper, nickel, coal.
There are also small resources of silver, gold, diamonds, and rubies.
• Main industries are oil, gas, textiles, timber, coffee, rubber, coal, tin, copper, rice, pepper, and palm oil.
• Indonesia supplies over 80% of Southeast Asia’s oil and over 35% of worldwide liquefied gas.
• Exports have been a large factor in Indonesia’s growth, with semi-processed and manufactured products dominating the export market.
Gross Domestic Product (2005)
Indonesia’s merchandise import growth surpassed export growth in 2005, with growth of 26.2% and 21.8% respectively.
Total Indonesian imports grew 16% from 2004 to 2005.
Private consumption expenditure has been expanding since 1999 and has played a significant role in economic growth.
Inflation was 7.2% in 2005, and the unemployment rate was 9.4%.
Bank Indonesia has been executing a tight monetary policy, and aiming for a government inflation target of 7-9%.
Fiscal policy was more expansive in 2006, with the Government promoting infrastructure development.
Considerable cuts were made to fuel subsidies, which have long been straining the fiscal budget.
Forecast:
• GDP growth is projected to slow slightly in 2006, with an estimated annual growth of 5.5%, and increase in 2007 with growth of 5.7%.
An average growth of 6.6% a year is expected for the economy from 2005 to 2009.
• From 2004-2009, development policies and strategies combined with market reforms are expected to result in favourable macro-economic conditions.
• In the second half of 2006, interest rates are expected to decrease as a result of exchange rate stabilization and decreased pressure on year-on-year inflation rates.
An approximate interest rate of 10% is expected for the end of 2006 and external debt ratios are predicted to steadily decline.
• Inflation is expected to stay within the 2006 target of 7-9%.
• Social welfare is also expected to improve and the poverty rate is projected to decline to 8.2% of the population in 2009.
In 2004, 16.7% of the population lived below the poverty line.
This new law, coupled with rebounding investment may help Indonesia’s economy to reach a more sustainable level.
• In 2007, a less stringent monetary situation and lower inflation are expected to significantly improve Indonesia’s domestic demand.
• Significant surpluses are predicted for 2006 and 2007, due to expected high levels of merchandise exports.
Consumer Market Indonesia has a population of approximately 234 million growing at a rate of 1.4% annually.
By 2010, the population is expected to reach 245 million and as the population grows, so will population density and urbanization.
Despite government efforts to control migration flows, urbanization continues to spread.
In 2005, the urban population composed 45% of the total population and is expected to grow 54% from 2000 to 2015.
Java island is experiencing extreme urbanization.
The entire island is now one large city where more than half the Indonesian population resides.
Approximately 8.8 million Indonesian’s live in the city of Jakarta.
Demographics
•
•
• Indonesia has a fairly young population with a median age of 26 years.
The overall population is maturing gradually, with a median age of 29 years projected for 2015.
Declining fertility rates and increased life expectancy, due to improved education, living conditions, and health awareness, are the reasons for this maturing population.
The age structure of the population is as follows: 0-14 years (29%), 15-64 years (66%), 65 years and older (5%).
Population age groups under 20 years of age are projected to decrease between 1.4-3.6% from 2000 to 2015, whereas population age groups that are 45 years or older are expected to grow between 65-70%.
300 ethnic groups are present in the country, with 88% of the population being Muslim.
• Almost 40% of households were located in the highest income bracket in 2003.
This number is significantly higher than the income bracket with the next largest number of households, which was roughly 9% of total Indonesian households.
The proportion of households in the lowest income bracket is decreasing, while the number of households in the highest income bracket had an estimated growth of 46% from 2000 to 2003 and continues to increase.
In 2005, consumer expenditure grew 2% and totalled US$157.6 billion.
Food is a large portion of the average Indonesian’s per capita expenditures, accounting for 55% of total expenditure in 2004.
Consumer expenditure on food and non-alcoholic beverages is projected to grow by 80% from 2000 to 2015.
Compared with food expenditure, expenditure on alcoholic beverages is very low; however there is a trend towards more expenditure on alcoholic beverages and less on common beverages.
Packaged food expenditure has increased due to a larger consumer base and more frequent consumption; overall consumption is still fairly low.
Lifestyle and Diet
•
•
December 2006
Alcohol consumption is low because Indonesia is a largely Muslim state and even non-Muslim Indonesians do not drink significant amounts.
Bottled water, ready to drink tea and fruit/vegetable juice are very popular.
Consumers generally prefer fresh food to packaged food as it is perceived as healthier.
• Consumers are becoming more sophisticated, incomes are rising, and consumers with middle-to-upper level incomes are increasing.
These factors provide a growing customer base and opportunity for high-value, value-added products in the Indonesian market.
With consumers’ increasingly busy lifestyles and health awareness, there is an overall growing demand for functional food and beverage products.
Packaged food retail sales were expected to grow by more than 15% in 2005.
Frozen processed food was expected to grow the strongest, by 31% in 2005, and manufacturers are offering more specific and varied products.
In packaged food, there is a trend toward smaller packaging, particularly singleservings and refill packs.
Health and nutritional awareness is expected to lead to a growing trend toward white meat and seafood consumption, while red meat consumption will decline.
Increasing product availability in retail and foodservice is expected to further improve fish and seafood consumption.
Fresh fish and seafood are most popular, however frozen fish and seafood are growing in popularity.
Consumers are beginning to perceive fish and seafood as a healthier source of protein compared with alternative meat products.
This trend is predominantly visible in the younger generation; 15 years to early 30’s.
There is large potential for wheat flour due to the popularity of noodles and baked goods and the presence of in-house bakery formats in retailing.
Annual flour consumption is among the lowest in the world, leaving considerable room for growth in this industry as wheat-based products become increasingly popular with consumers.
Retailing
Hypermarkets grew the fastest of all grocery retail channels in 2005, with surface area growth of 51% and outlet growth of 55%.
Despite the rapid growth of modern retailing, ‘other’ grocery retailers composed 95% of all grocery outlets and nearly 56% of grocery sales.
Another intra-regional trade incentive is the close geographic proximity of member countries.
However, Canada is a large trading partner with ASEAN, which places Canada in a good position with respect to Canadian-Indonesian trade.
While strong intra-regional trade among ASEAN members is expected to continue, Indonesia’s agri-food and seafood imports are not primarily supplied by ASEAN countries.
• Japan is a major trading partner with Indonesia and has become the country’s largest export market, surpassing the U.S. Indonesia’s top 5 import sources in 2005:
Australia (19%), U.S. (16%), Thailand (11%), China (6%), and Argentina (6%).
Australia mainly supplies cereals, dairy products, bird eggs, honey, cotton, live animals, and sugars and sugar confectionary.
The U.S. supplies oilseeds, cotton, food industry residues and waste, dairy products, bird eggs, honey, and edible fruit and nuts.
Access Issues Indonesian government control of food imports and distribution has lessened in recent years, however heavy import regulation still exists.
All food and agriculture import products require registration with the National Agency of Drugs and Food
A 10% value-added-tax is levied on all agriculture product imports: meat and live cattle included.
Fresh produce imports must have a phytosanitary certificate which can be obtained from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) http://www.inspection.gc.ca/. Upon arriving in the country, products are subject to a plant quarantine inspection.
Alcoholic beverages face greater access issues, being strictly controlled and charged with sizeable excise rates.
Food labelling must be in Indonesian and include the following information: product name, ingredient list, net weight/volume, manufacturer/importer name and address, Halal information, and expiry date.
The BPOM registration number, production code, and ‘use by’ date are also mandatory on food labels.
When entering the Indonesian agriculture import market it is important to appoint a reliable business partner and to arrange face-to-face meetings as often as possible.
Business partners can be very beneficial as major importers generally have their own network distribution and facilities for cold storage.
Distributors generally add a 10% mark-up.
Participating in main trade shows is also a beneficial forum for gaining entrance to the market.
Business Travel Tips
• Modest, ‘business casual’ attire is acceptable.
A business suit, batik shirt, or dress for women, is commonly worn in business situations.
Hand shaking should be done with the right hand.
Business cards are frequently used.
Offer and accept cards with your right hand and treat the business cards of others with respect.
• 11% of Indonesia’s land is arable, 7% is used for permanent crops, and 45,000 sq km is irrigated.
Of the ASEAN countries, Indonesia has by far the largest amount of arable land.
Indonesia has long been a prominent palm oil producer, and in 2006 the country surpassed Malaysia to become the world’s largest producer.
There are currently expansion plans underway to establish the largest palm plantation in the world.
Main agriculture products are rice, cassava (tapioca), peanuts, rubber, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, copra, poultry, beef, pork, and eggs.
Rice, sugar, coconuts, and corn represent approximately 94% of Indonesia’s domestic crop production.
Chicken is the most produced type of meat, followed by pork.
However, Indonesians do not consume large amounts of pork and the majority of domestic production is exported to Singapore.
The country still experiences substantial problems with the quality of dairy cattle breeding and stock.
There is an active fish and seafood fishing sector and cultivation also plays a role in supporting the fish and seafood industry.
Indonesia does not possess very modern fishing technology which has a negative effect on the quality of domestic fresh fish.
Imported fish and seafood products are directly distributed and sold to modern retail outlets, hotels, and restaurants.
materials are often directly imported by food processors, with complementary ingredients commonly purchased from local agents.
Organic farming is still very limited in Indonesia.

Market Information Southeast Asia Food and Beverage Retail Report - Singapore February 2003 Prepared for the Canadian High Commission, Singapore by Jennifer C. S. Norris
Table of Contents Introduction The Singapore Market  The Retail Sector (grocery trade) Supermarkets in Singapore The Players and their Market Schedule of Listing Fees Canadian Opportunities - Trends and Constraints  Food and Beverage Retail Survey  Company Index Conclusions  Key Government Contacts and Sources of Information
Introduction The Food & Beverage Retail Report has been devised as a handbook of practical information for use by Canadian agri-food exporters whose preliminary research has identified the Singapore market for possible penetration, whether solely within the country or as a strategy into the region.
This document has been created as an update of the original report carried out by the Canadian High Commission of Singapore and published in January 2000.
The objective is to provide an updated and qualified list of active companies who have indicated interest in importing and distributing Canadian agri-food products for the retail market.
All companies listed within this report have responded to a retail survey conducted through the Commercial Section of the Canadian High Commission in Singapore.
The survey was conducted over a period of three weeks in December 2002.
Data was derived from the survey,s 11 predominantly close-ended question.
Additional information on the specific product group interests and future intentions were conducted through a random sampling of respondents with an additional interview process, to both extract greater specifics as well as validate information gathered through the survey.
These interviews were conducted in the first part of January 2003.
A total of 52 companies responded by returning the survey form.
This report also summarizes information related to the general business climate in Singapore as well as background information related to the Retail Food & Beverage Industry.
Profiles of the leading supermarkets, as well as recent changes and developments in this sector are covered in this report.
The background information on the business climate was obtained through various statistics provided by the Government of Canada, the Government of the Republic of Singapore, and various authorities within Singapore.
The Canadian High Commission in Singapore hopes that this report will assist Canadian agri-food exporters to more accurately target their product offerings, and speed potential business connections within Singapore.
Companies who are interested in pursuing businesses listed in this report are encouraged to use the contact information provided in the index for each of these companies.
The Singapore Market Singapore, an island city-state located at the tip of peninsular Malaysia in the heart of Southeast Asia, has an area of about 648 km².
In spite of its small size and lack of natural resources, Singapore,s over 3-million population enjoys one of the most affluent per-capita GDPs in Asia at approximately US$24,000 (S$44,000).
Singapore,s trade was about 2.7 times the size of its GDP in 1999.
Singapore,s business strengths focus mainly on utilizing its free trade policy along with the country,s position in the heart of the Asia-Pacific region.
Singapore,s excellent business services, financial and manufacturing sectors are supported by one of the busiest ports and largest container ports in the world.
Its efficient Changi international airport allows a free-flow of people and goods to Singapore, both as a destination as well as a gateway to ASEAN and Pacific Rim markets.
A pro-business approach to policy and processes has given Singapore a list of accolades which include World,s 2nd freest economy (Economic Freedom of the World: 2002 Annual Report); Fifth least corrupt nation (Corruption Perception Index 2002); Best airport worldwide (IATA 2002); World,s 5th most competitive economy (World Competitiveness Yearbook 2002); and, World,s 4th most competitive economy (Global Competitiveness Report 2002).
In spite of its economy being hard-hit by the Asian Financial Crisis of the late 1990s, the country,s sound legal framework, clean and efficient government, emphasis on education and science and technology, good labour/employer relations, competitive telecommunications and increasingly competitive financial system makes the island-state a safe bet for continued international business.
Regional Singapore has been historically recognized as Southeast Asia,s distribution hub, and has been the base of operations for many food and beverage importers and exporters, providing administrative and financial support for business establishments in other countries in the region.
This role, however, may be daunted in the future by the additional infrastructure being completed around Southeast Asia.
Shipping destinations at Johor Bahru and Port Klang in Malaysia will challenge the country,s ability to maintain its part as a trans-shipment point for the region.
However, Singapore,s long-standing ability to 'facilitate, around the region, tapping on computer and communications technology, incentives, and financial support, should retain its title as a vibrant entrance and distribution point for international business.
Notwithstanding the repercussions of the Asian economic crisis, Singapore has continued to pursue liberal trade and investment policies and to deepen internal reform, especially in key services.
A new WTO report on Singapore's trade policies says that Singapore has weathered the recent economic crisis in the region well mainly due to its stable and sound macroeconomic policies and its open trade and investment regime."
World Trade Organization, Press Release, 22 March 2000.
The Retail Sector (grocery trade) Description Singapore continues to be considered one of the most developed food retail markets in Southeast Asia.
With high disposable income, the monthly per capita food expenditure is S$219.30, based on the most recent Singapore Statistics Household Expenditure Survey (1997/98).
This amount comprises an average monthly per capita expenditure of S$99.60 and S$119.70 on non-cooked and cooked food respectively.
Due to the dearth of agricultural land on the island, Singaporeans are more dependent on imported food and beverage, resulting in higher expenditure on food products compared to neighbouring countries.
Catering primarily to household consumption, the grocery trade can be generally divided into three main categories of marketing channels and distribution.
Provision shops are no-frills, small stores usually set up in highly populated residential areas to cater specifically to those "block" areas.
They are usually family run and staffed.
Mini-marts offer a slightly broader range of products in a more comfortable setting which increasingly includes some air conditioning.
Supermarkets (added together by Statistics Singapore as Supermarkets and Departmental Stores cum Supermarkets) provide an extensive selection of products and tend to offer higher end products in the mix within an air-conditioned environment.
There are some general trends that have occurred from 1987.
This is due to the reduced number of general provision shops and the increased number of both mini-marts and supermarkets.
While these two latter categories have more than doubled their numbers since 1987, the number of provision shops has plummeted.
Number of Stores in Grocery Trade There may be several reasons for this shift.
Economic growth and generally higher incomes have enabled individuals to shop in establishments with greater selection and comfort.
The shift from provision shop to mini-mart seems to also hold advantages for small entrepreneurs in that these mini-marts are often franchised and provide the owner with better management systems, stock control and more effective purchasing power.
For those with good business savvy, existing provision shops have been "up-grading" to mini-marts.
With the emergence of both national and international supermarket chains, which tend to be more aggressive in their marketing strategies, the number of stores has risen from 60 in 1987 to about 153 in 2000.
These establishments also provide a much higher level of employment as they have expanded, compared to provision shops or mini-marts.
As the supermarkets continue to consolidate and increase their buying power, they will become an even greater force in Singapore.
Even after the tough economic climate of the late 1990s, the grocery trade has grown.
From 1987 to 1997 turnover increased at about 7.2 per cent annually, supporting the growing population and the increased demand for grocery products amongst consumers.
Turnover by Store Format Supermarkets recorded the highest growth, especially between 1997 and 2000.
Some factors that have supported the trend towards supermarket shopping are that supermarkets have been moving into the "heartlands" of residential housing for increased access.
Individuals are also becoming more affluent and savvy to a wider variety of foods and grocery products, thus demanding a wider range of goods.
Finally, the number of working women continues to increase.
This group tends to prefer shopping in supermarkets for convenience, atmosphere and value for money.
It looks as though these trends will continue to make supermarket shopping a preferred, although not exclusive, choice for Singaporean grocery shoppers in the future.
Even within the category of supermarket, there has been and increase in the focus of target market levels that range from upmarket to discount format.
The players, their store numbers and markets are listed below.
Carrefour This well-known hypermarket from France is present in 31 countries around the world and entered the Singapore scene within the last four years.
Known for its deep pockets, this hypermarket did not expand quickly to additional locations and remained with its one (1) flagship store within the central business district since inception.
Its broad, international variety of food and beverage products stems mostly from European, and predominantly French, sources.
It was recently announced, however, that it will finally be opening a second store in Plaza Singapura, at the heart of one of the new public mass transit interchanges in the central city and shopping area.
Carrefour Singapore Pte Ltd  3 Temasek Boulevard #01-043  Suntec City Mall, Singapore 038983  Tel: +65 6333 6868  Singapore@carrefour.com Giant Giant offers a wide range of local merchandise and a wet market environment.
Following the successful launch of this format of stores in Malaysia, Giant,s emphasis of its stores is "Ethnic and Fresh".
There are presently three (3) hypermarket stores in Singapore, opened in relative quick succession.
Giant is a 100% owned company of the Dairy Farm Group, who also own Cold Storage (G,value and Jason,s described below).
Dairy Farm Group also owns 7-Eleven Convenience Stores, as well as Guardian Pharmacies across Singapore.
There are 25 outlets under the Cold Storage label, one (1) Jason,s store which is positioned as more of a "purveyor of fine food and wine", four (4) Market Place stores which cater to the upper income markets, and nine (9) G,Value shops, which have been positioned to target local value-conscious residents looking for everyday needs.

In 2002, FairPrice was in the process of building a central fresh food distribution centre to increase cost savings over the long term.
FairPrice continues to have the highest number of outlets positioned throughout all areas of Singapore.

With the mission of "Great Value Always" Shop N Save has expanded using its major discounter entry position.
The company now has 35 outlets around the country.
QAF Ltd and Delhaize "The Lion" Group are both owners in this supermarket chain and are looking to expand aggressively into the regional market.

As suggested by its name, Shing Shiong caters more to local fare and tastes.
A minor player in the supermarket scene, the company has six (6) outlets in Singapore.
Schedule of Listing Fees Singapore is the first country in the Southeast Asian region to implement slotting fees.
While not all supermarkets practice this fee structure, two of the biggest supermarket players, Cold Storage and NTUC FairPrice do.
Below are examples of slotting listing fees that give an example of the potential costs for products being brought to Singapore.
Canadian Opportunities - Trends and Constraints Generally, the Singapore market is a good one to enter into for Canadian agri-food producers.
There is an affluent and expanding market within the country and many of the Singaporean importers and exporters of products are interested in taking advantage of their regional hub position to expand into Southeast Asia and beyond.
Singapore, however, is extremely price conscious.
With the increasingly savvy population, innovative and value-added products are in higher demand, but with a cost sensitivity that should be noted.
Agri-food products imported into Singapore must conform to regulatory requirements.
Health certificates and supporting documentation are needed for meat, poultry and seafood items.
Canada and Singapore have agreed to specific import regulatory requirements for most meat imports, including bison.
However, other exotic meats currently do not have agreements in place.
The issue of Halal products, those that are handled and processed within the requirements of the Muslim community, is becoming increasingly important for widespread acceptance in Singapore.
Many importers and questioning the viability of non-Halal certified food and beverage products in this country and region.
Major agri-food sources to Singapore include Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and some of the European countries.
Their perceived proximity, compared to North America and especially Canada, gives them an advantage of being top of mind.
More often than not, proximity is associated with lower cost and increased freshness.
Based on the interviews conducted for this survey, Canada can take advantage of its exchange rate to differentiate itself from the United States.
Canada seems recognized as a high quality producer of food and beverage products but may need to take advantage of goods that have added value as opposed to commodity level products.
However, with the question of safe supplies of products, and specifically in meats, secondary sourcing may be a valuable opportunity for Canada.
Comments from some of the companies interviewed suggested that "healthy" was an increasing buzzword in Singapore - organic, health, fresh.
It was also indicated that convenience foods - frozen goods that can be place in chillers and are ready to serve, from meals to desserts - are in increasing demand, both for retail customers as well as food services.
Adding to the convenience trend, Petrol (gas) station grocery outlets are becoming increasingly popular for basic goods, confectionery products and ready-to-serve items.
Canada,s reputation as a solid supplier needs to be backed with a willingness to build a relationship with Singapore importers.
With the size of the Singapore market remaining small, the need for consolidators or the facilitation of smaller orders will be key in accessing and expanding in this market.

As a predominantly fresh food arm, the company presently brings in strawberries from California as well as other berries from the USA by air.
Salads for the company are sourced from Europe.
However, they would be interested in finding other suppliers to bring in a wide variety of products, noting that freight, transit periods and handling are all going concerns.
Forecore at the moment has a tendency to be pro-European in their product line, due to proximity as well as subsidies.
The company's work with modified packaging is increasing their interest in short shelf life products and items from further away.
Future plans for the company are to open large, urban-based gourmet shops, with the possibility of a North American area to highlight specialties.
Competitive cheese and dairy, pastry products, deli meats, berries, seafood (oysters) and other niche or gourmet products are of interest to the company.
Their interests in the bakery business may increase their needs for innovative expansion products and supplies.
The company has a good awareness of Canada and has a long history with the country.

All parts of the company are aiming at the high upper-middle end of the market.
Halal products are seen as very important for sales in Singapore especially convenience products, frozen pastries, ready to eat and pre-packaged foods.
As a supplier for convenience stores in Singapore, desserts and frozen cheesecakes are increasingly popular.
The situation in Singapore is very price competitive.
The market for frozen convenience (both retail as well as food services) is growing and there is a dearth of innovative products.
Convenience products in the dry goods area is also something that the company is interested to look into.
Products for both retail and food services GTK has been looking for Canadian suppliers for food products.
They are interested in locating products that are "innovative", "meaningful", "funky" - items with nice packaging, a great taste, with the concept of "natural" foods running through their line.
They are open to many ranges with value-added products and gourmet foods as a specialty.
Possible products of interest are organic or natural cereals, gourmet soda pops like root beer, premium ice cream and dairy products.
Soy-based snacks must be flavourful (as must all foods for the Singapore market) - bland foods in this spice-taking country does not sell as well.
GTK provide for food service as well as their own restaurants and are in the market for bakery goods and ready cooked foods as there tends to be limited kitchen sizes that cafes are working with.
The company is planning to expand into Malaysian a much more aggressive way in the future.
While the Canadian dollar is favourable at the moment, shipping costs seem to be of concern.

Meidiya Japan, in a joint venture, owns part of Meidi-ya Singapore Co.
Either through Meidi-ya Japan or Lim Mah Tat, the companies Nor-Scan and Be Fresh are associated to the group.
This gives them group buying power and they can take advantage of some of the cost advantages where possible.
However, even with this larger purchase power, the company feels it is buying small quantities and is looking for a consolidator in Canada for regular consignments of meat, cheese, salad, and seafood products.
The company is also looking for high quality beef products.
As of 1 April 2003, the company will be taking over on the retail front to own a retail supermarket.
This will open up an avenue for providing products to the store directly.
Part of the Meidiya associated group (see Meidiya company write up).
Products the company are interested in include clams, oysters, hokigai, and whelks.
The quantities that are ordered are on the low volume end.
Smoked salmon which might have been sourced from North America is now sourced locally.
The company is also getting sausages from the USA - with the Euro going up, they are looking to North America for purchases.

Conclusions In the area of Food and Beverage Retail, the information and statistics provided in this report should provide Canadian companies with some basic tools to use when approaching potential import/export or development partners in Singapore.
There appear to be many Singapore businesses that are looking for long-term partnerships with innovative products.
As Singapore remains a smaller market, these companies are looking to work with Canadian companies to find solutions which lead to mutually beneficial relationships.

______________________________________________________________________________ The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on primary and secondary sources of information.
Readers should independently verify the accuracy and reliability of the information.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
Malaysia COUNTRY PROFILE Economy Malaysia is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
Malaysia has developed from an agriculture based economy to an industrial manufacturing based economy, though the country maintains strong manufacturing, service and agricultural sectors.
Malaysia is export oriented and is particularly reliant on the export of electronics.
Malaysia is both politically and economically stable and is open to foreign investment.
Overview The Malaysian government has laid out a vision for the country’s economy.
The vision is working to increase the country’s GDP eightfold helping the country achieve "industrialized country" status by the year 2020.
The foundation of this national development is privatization, while maintaining an emphasis on foreign investment to support industrialization.
Manufacturing is central to the economy and the country is heavily reliant on a healthy export market for its industry.
One of the most important industries in Malaysia is the food manufacturing industry.
There is a range of businesses in the industry, from small family owned operations to large international companies.
Major manufactured products include refined sugar, wheat flour and baked products, non-alcoholic beverages, edible oil, dairy products, confectionery and snacks, fish and seafood products, beer, canned pineapple and processed meat.
The food processing industry is expected to expand in the future.
Current situation Malaysia’s GDP has seen healthy growth since since 1998, with the exception of 2001 when a global slowdown negatively affected Malaysia’s export oriented economy.
Growth returned in occurred in 2002 and has continued in 2003.
Consumer confidence has increased, and has been shown through purchases of large items, increased consumer credit and mortgage approvals, and an increase in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.
Investor confidence has also increased, as applications for foreign direct investment have increased.
The unemployment rate in Malaysia is quite low at approximately 3.5%.
However, about 8% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Government Role The government is actively involved in the development and industrialization of the Malaysian economy.
This includes state sector investment, a close alliance between the government and the private business sector, privatizing state enterprises, and a variety of policies and programs to bolster the economic status of Malaysian communities.
The role of the government in agriculture is to provide support to facilitate the business and development activities of the private sector and of producers.
Consumer Market The largest percentage of the Malaysian population, about half, are Malays.
This group is followed by Chinese, making up approximately 25%.
Total Population Population Growth Rate Breakdown by Age 0-14 yrs 15-64 yrs 65 yrs and over Life Expectancy Male Female Total
semi-prepared foods or takeaway meals and can afford to do so.
This group is increasingly exposed to global and western influences and will be a driving force within Malaysia for higher value products, including food.
Geography Malaysia is located in southeastern Asia, sharing common borders with Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.
The capital of Malaysia is Kuala Lumpur.
Muslims in Malaysia only eat beef and poultry products which have been approved by Malaysian authorities as "halal", or acceptable for consumption by Muslims.
They do not eat pork.
In contrast, Buddhists and Hindus do not eat beef.
Therefore, chicken meat is most popular in general.
There are 3650 square kilometers of irrigated land in Malaysia.
Natural resources include tin, petroleum, timber, copper, iron ore, natural gas and bauxite.
There are an estimated 400,000 hectares of idle agricultural land in Malaysia.
Industrial,
Infrastructure Malaysia has well developed transportation and communication infrastructure.
Malaysia has modern and efficient transportation services.
Major cities are connected by highways.
The majority of cargo shipments – about 90% – are transported by road.
Railway lines also connect the north, south, east and west coasts, in addition to the roadways.
All major cities have airports as well; there are seven international airports in Malaysia.
Approximately 90% of Malaysia’s imports are transported to the country by sea.
This makes the development of efficient ports very important.
More than two thirds of the people who frequent these restaurants are in the "teen" market.
Increasing direct shipments, intense restaurant competition, and a strong retail sector should allow the Malaysian food market to maintain growth.
Goods are generally marketed through agents or distributors who operate sales outlets in the major cities in Malaysia.
The products are then distributed to supermarkets, hotels, rural shops and other retail outlets.
Some of the larger supermarket chains are beginning to import directly from overseas.
Shipments through Singapore are declining as the ports in Malaysia improve.
This is to ensure the safety of the products and compliance with regulations and standards.
Malaysia’s economy rely’s on exporting.
Exports were valued at $131.2 billion, while imports were valued at $112.4 billion resulting in a positive trade balance of $19 billion.
Malaysia’s exports are dominated by electronic products and other manufactured goods, such as furniture.
Additional exports include: petroleum and liquefied natural gas, wood and wood products, palm oil, rubber,
______________________________________________________________________________ Country Profile:
Malaysia’s largest export partners include: the US, Singapore, the EU, Japan, Hong Kong.
Malaysia’s major import suppliers include:
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Malaysia was strong, as a result of the privatisation, until the Asian economic crisis.
Foreign direct investment has been an important aspect of the development of Malaysia.
In the 1990s, the majority of investment went to the manufacturing sector, followed by oil and gas, services, and property.
However, this flow has decreased in recent years.
Competition from other markets such as China and less developed Southeast Asian countries has affected Malaysia.
The government has worked to bring investment to high technology, capital intensive manufacturing operations.
The top contributors of FDI to Malaysia are Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Total inflows of FDI in 2001 were US$554 million.
The Malaysian Industrial Development Authority (MIDA) performs screening for all foreign and domestic investments.
As a member of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), Malaysia is involved in reducing trade barriers over a fifteen year period with fellow AFTA member.
These include Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos and Burma.
Malaysia is also a member of the following international organizations:
Malaysia 2003 7
Market Access Exporters of agri-food products to Malaysia face a number of challenges when entering the market.
The market for imported foods continues to be liberalized as tariffs are reduced for most products.
Luxury goods are heavily taxed, while goods such as raw materials, essential foodstuffs, and pharmaceutical products are subject to reduced duties.
Many other goods, which are to be used in Malaysia’s development, also benefit from lower duties.
Although tariffs have been reduced on a number of goods, certain sectors still have high rates in order to regulate imports.
Certification Requirements Imported meat products must be from approved halal facilities because the products cannot be sold to Muslims in Malaysia unless they are certified halal.
Imports from China also require special permits.
If a specific license is not required, a "Declaration of Goods Imported" form must be filled out at the point of import.
Documentation is generally handled by international freight forwarders.
Packaging and Labelling All imported consumer goods must be affixed with a label identifying the importing agent.
This is generally done after the goods have cleared customs.
Processed food products must show the name of the manufacturer and packer or importer on the product label as well as the weight or volume, common name, brand, content or list of ingredients in accordance to proportion by weight, animal product content, alcohol content, additives and storage instructions.
Expiry dates are required on certain produce, perishable foods, and goods with short shelf lives.
Nutritional information is optional except for baby food, processed food for children, cereal and food for dietary purposes.
Malaysian consumers are price sensitive.
Canadian products are not always pricecompetitive when compared to local products and imports from other neighboring countries.
The price sensitivity of consumers directly affects the sector’s buyers and their suppliers.
Peninsular Malaysia - rubber, palm oil, cocoa, rice; from Sabah - subsistence crops, rubber, timber, coconuts, rice; and from Sarawak rubber, pepper; timber.
The deficit is expected to continue as a result of economic factors that limit Malaysia’s capabilities.
Malaysia needs to increase the competitive capabilities of food production within the country, however, the agricultural sector faces challenges such as acute labour shortages, limited availability of suitable land and increasing cost of production.
Competition for resources from other sectors and competition in the global market has contributed to these challenges.
Strong local brands that have foreign origin, for example Nestlé and Coca Cola, command strong positions in their market segments.
Agriculture and Agri-food Overview and Outlook
The agriculture sector plays a rapidly diminishing role in Malaysia’s economy.
Over 3,500sq km of land is irrigated.
Malaise’ primary agricultural products include: from
other sectors and expand into new areas, while maintaining the ability to conserve and utilize natural resources.
The specific objectives of the NAP3 are: to enhance food security; to increase productivity and competitiveness of the sector; to deepen linkages with other sectors; to create new sources of growth for the sector; and to conserve and utilize natural resources on a sustainable basis.
Initiatives to promote new products and emerging industries such as agroforestry, biotechnology products, specialty natural products, bamboo and rattan, floriculture and aquarium fish are expected to be sources of growth for the agricultural sector.
Although land expansion is not likely to occur, productivity is expected to increase during the NAP3 period, due to increased labour productivity.
This will reflect the emphasis put on labour saving technology, innovations and more efficient farm management practices.
As well, moderate expansion of land will still be pursued in some areas, such as agroforestry, oil palm, and fruit and vegetable cultivation.
This will require key elements of the country’s economic foundation, such as human resources, technology, physical infrastructure, finance and incentives, and supporting industries and institutions, to be continuously developed.
New Zealand is the leading exporter of dairy products to Malaysia, Australia is the leading exporter of meat products, and both countries are among the top exporters of fresh fruit and vegetables and wines.
These two countries have the advantage of shorter, and therefore cheaper, shipping times.
China is among the leading exporters of fresh fruits, along with Thailand and Indonesia.
Trade organizations such as the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers and the government agency, Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (MATRADE), aggressively promote and assist Malaysia’s food industry export market.
Canada - Malaysia Trade and Investment
The Canadian and Malaysian governments have developed a good relationship since Malaysia's independence in 1957.
This relationship has been strengthened by the two countries' record of cooperation as members of the Commonwealth, the United Nations and the World Trade Organization; as participants in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum, which deals with security issues; and through ASEAN itself, of which Canada is a dialogue partner.

Agri-Food Regional Profile of ASEAN
Michael Ash Trade Evaluation and Analysis Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada ashmi@agr.gc.ca
The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on primary and secondary sources of information.
Readers should take note that the Government of Canada does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in this report, nor does it necessarily endorse the organizations listed herein.
Readers should independently verify the accuracy and reliability of the information.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
Executive Summary ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is a regional group that has, over the last two decades, become more interested in increased economic integration between its members.
ASEAN members are a highly heterogeneous group, with political structures ranging from democracies to military dictatorships, and certain development rivalling that of Western Europe coupled with some of the poorest countries in the world.
Even though the overall region is relatively poor, strong real GDP growth, both recorded and forecast, make this an interesting and potentially lucrative market.
Canadian agri-food and seafood exports to ASEAN are small and confined to only a few products, wheat and soybeans being the most important.
In 2003, exports were valued at $506 million.
Trade and domestic economic liberalization coupled with rising incomes makes ASEAN a potential growth market for Canadian goods.
History and Future of ASEAN ASEAN was created in 1967 by five member states – Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand initially as a mechanism to protect against a perceived Communist threat within the region.
It has since expanded to include Brunei (1984), Cambodia (1999), Laos (1997), Myanmar (1997) and Viet Nam (1995) and has arguably become the most successful economic association primarily involving developing countries.
Much of the group’s initial dialogue consisted of non-economic issues, such as regional stability and peace.
Starting in 1992, there was a dramatic shift to better address common economic concerns.
One of the most important principles agreed upon was the establishment of an ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA).
The AFTA, formalized in 1993, requires that the first six member countries register most product classifications as part of their Inclusion List (IL).
The items in their inclusion lists were then proscribed to fall to tariff levels between zero and five per cent, with 60 per cent at zero.
As of 2003, 99.6 per cent were in this range.
ASEAN Secretariat
The direction of ASEAN’s economic focus is oriented towards greater trade liberalization.
It is optimistically scheduled that there will be zero tariffs on all intra-ASEAN trade by 2015 and a single market for goods, services and investments by 2020.
Agriculture has been identified as one of the priority markets that requires added attention in the integration process.
Because of increased linkages between the regions and a confluence of domestic regulations, ASEAN members have also indicated interest in branding ASEAN, using methods such as "Made in ASEAN" labelling.
Similar to the beginnings of the European Union, ASEAN is increasing presenting a common front in bilateral trade negotiations.
Talks have started with both China and India and ASEAN members are optimistic that free trade areas with these countries can be negotiated and completed by 2010 and 2016, respectively.2 The ASEAN Economy Unlike many other regional associations, ASEAN did not form out of then-present common political ideologies or economic circumstances.
The only common factor that linked them was geographical proximity.
Although the countries remain at highly different levels of development, it is their new-found common outlook for the economic development of the region that joins them.
Population Population growth 2
"ASEAN seeks to fast-track economic integration," AFP, Jan.
Other measures of development, such as international aid per capita, reveal similar heterogeneity between countries as with incomes.
Net FDI flows, on the other hand, are less varied between countries and, in all cases but one, are positive inflows.
Their levels are low, relative to world levels, especially when compared against other stable, developing countries.
Within the last decade, all the countries have rapidly increased production of agricultural products (see table 2).
Livestock production has outpaced overall food production in the entire region, an indication that local producers are responding to increased domestic demand for high-value products resulting from rising incomes.
Land productivity as measured by cereal yield, for example, is relatively consistent among ASEAN.
Physical capital is much larger in the EU, as they record 94 tractors per thousand hectares in comparison to the ASEAN average of eight.
Given these large resource bases for European agriculture, with similar levels of inputs, ASEAN farmers would probably be able to easily increase production.
With rising wealth, these inputs should become more accessible to the average farmer.
FAO Statistics, World Development Indicators (World Bank).
Arable land is in millions of hectares in 2000, food production index in 2001 is such that 1989-91=100, livestock production index in 2001 is such that 1989-1991=100, cereal yield is in kilograms per hectare, fertilizer use is tonnes per thousand hectares of arable land in 2001, and tractor use is tractors per thousand hectares.
Other ASEAN members accounted for over 70 per cent of import demand.
As mentioned before, exports are small in comparison to Brunei’s imports.
In 2001, agri-food exports valued $1.6 million USD and imports $189.6 million USD.
The largest category of imports was cereals.
Some of the smaller categories in which it was a large importer were bakery products, beer, cigarettes, and fruits.
World Trade Atlas.
Canadian exports to this tiny country are very small, amounting to only a few hundred thousand dollars annually.
Table 4 describes the various commodities exported.
Although recent trends suggest that Canada has done well in Brunei, exports in 1995 exceeded $600,000.
Plantations have been encouraged and are focused on palm oil, cashews, coffee, tea, and vegetables.
Other important commodities were alcoholic beverages, malt extract, and milk products.
In that year, like many others, Canada did not export any agri-food and seafood products to Cambodia and thereby had no market presence.
Table 5 Canadian Agri-Food and Seafood Exports to Cambodia 2001 2002 2003 TOTAL AGRI-FOOD EXPORTS $0 $0 $22,000 Cookies $0 $0 $22,000 Source:
Canadian agri-food and seafood exports to Cambodia were nonexistent from 1998 to 2002; in 2003, exports were minimal, as seen in table 5.
Indonesia Like many of the other ASEAN countries, Indonesia has experienced a shaky foundation in the last fifteen years with both economic and political disturbances.
In primary crops, Indonesia is highly engaged in the production of rice, sugar, coconuts, and corn.
After chicken, the second-largest type of meat is, surprisingly, pork, which accounts for more than a quarter of meat production.
Most of the pork, however, is exported to Singapore.
Australia (20.2 per cent), the United States (18.6 per cent), China (11.2 per cent), India (7.2 per cent), and Thailand (5.9 per cent).
Overall, Indonesia’s main imports are basic commodities.
Table 6 outlines its main agri-food and seafood imports.
Much the same reason exists for cotton and oilseeds.
Canadian exports to Indonesia are almost exclusively focused on cereals.
Table 7 Canadian Agri-Food and Seafood Exports to Indonesia 2001 2002 2003 TOTAL AGRI-FOOD EXPORTS $152.6 $171.5 $93.8 Wheat and meslin, nondurum $132.0 $135.0 $65.2 Potatoes, frozen, prepared $1.5 $2.0 $7.2 Skim milk powder $1.8 $2.6 $4.3 Flour meal & pellets (not edible) $4.8 $6.0 $4.1 Wheat, durum $4.1 $2.9 $2.6 Source:
Canada supplied 29.3 per cent of Indonesia’s import demand of non-durum wheat in 2002.
In 2003, Canada’s exports fell considerably
Value-added products, on the other hand, have shown continued growth in this market.
For example, the export of frozen potatoes, many of which are used in French fries, is a large growth market.
Laos Laos, much like Cambodia and Myanmar, is extremely poor.
Overseas development aid makes up more than 13.5 per cent of GDP.
Because of widespread subsistence farming and lack of a highly developed export sector, Laos was relatively unaffected by the Asian crisis of the late 1990s.
It has enjoyed high real growth rates for the past few years and is projected to continue doing so.
Primary crop production is almost exclusively focused on rice, while pork dominates meat production.
Like Viet Nam, Laos does not produce its own trade data and, as such, are derived through indirect means.
Laos imported $70.4 million USD worth of agricultural products in 2001.
The largest sector by value was beverages and tobacco, followed by cereals and related preparations.
Canadian Agri-Food and Seafood Exports to Laos 2001 2002 2003 TOTAL AGRI-FOOD EXPORTS $0 $0 $0 Source:
As seen in table 8, Canadian agri-food and seafood exports to Laos simply do not exist.
The last recorded export in this category was in 1988.
In 2003, no exports of any sort flowed between Canada and Laos.
It has been projected that the country will be a net oil importer by the end of the decade, but that its large gas deposits will continue to provide significant revenues.
Domestic meat production is dominated by chicken.
On the whole, Malaysia is a net agri-food exporter, as 2002 values reveal that imports were $4.7 billion USD and exports were $7.4 billion USD.
Table 9 below outlines the broad import categories of Malaysia.
Malaysia imports a wide variety of agri-food and seafood products, which has resulted from its higher income and thereby more differentiated tastes of its citizens.
Value is in millions of American dollars.
The two countries that border Malaysia play significant roles in its trade patterns.
Thailand (15.3 per cent), China (13.8 per cent), Australia (12.3 per cent), Indonesia (10.4 per cent), and the United States (9.0 per cent).
Although the world exports a wide variety of products to Malaysia, Canada’s exports are concentrated in two products: soybeans and wheat.
Myanmar Myanmar is the poorest of the ASEAN members and one of the poorest in the world.
Its government is run by the military and there are international concerns over human rights.
As such, international corporations are reticent to enter the market because of the resulting negative perception domestically.8 Agriculture accounts for a significant portion of both the economy and the labour force: 59 and 66 per cent, respectively.
This is despite widespread hunger within the country.
Domestic primary crop production is focused on rice, in which output increased 28 per cent between 1998 and 2002.
Prior to 2000, Myanmar was a net agri-food importer but, since that time, it has become a net exporter.
Its largest exports are fruits and vegetables.
Similarly seen in many other poor countries, the leading broad import group is beverages and tobacco.

Value is in Canadian dollars.
For the last decade, export values have never really reached above the 2003 value.
Although the Philippines was more insulated during the Asian crisis of the late 1990s than its neighbours, they also had not so fully participated in the large international capital inflows.
Over the last few years, the Philippines has recorded the lowest real per capita GDP growth of any ASEAN member.
to boost the economy, the government has undertaken a major initiative to increase infrastructure and reform the tax system.
In the lives of everyday people, agriculture still plays a large role, as more than 36 per cent of the labour force is engaged in this sector, contributing 20 per cent of GDP.
World Trade Atlas.
Its exports were mostly primary goods such as bananas and coconut oil.
Imports, as outlined in table 12, were a varied group, consisting mainly of goods that are not wellsuited to the Philippine climate.
Before 2000, tobacco exports had been practically nonexistent.
Overall Canadian agri-food and seafood exports to this market have done extremely well, considering that mid-1990 values averaged slightly over $50 million.
Singapore Singapore is a small, highly open economy that has achieved significant wealth; GDP per capita is now on par with many Western industrialized countries.
Singapore has one of the world’s most open, trade-friendly economies, resulting from its high population density and the resulting lack of natural resources.
Singapore is home to the headquarters of over 3,000 multinational corporations and is a regional leader in exporting electronics.
Singapore is a large net agri-food and seafood importer, although this number is somewhat undervalued because of the significant impact of re-exports.
The largest exports were high value goods, such as beverages and tobacco products.
As for imports, table 14 outlines the leading categories.
Value is in millions of American dollars; Singapore does not record trade between itself and Indonesia
It should be noted that Singapore data do not include trade with Indonesia.
Above, in table 15, are Canada’s leading exports to Singapore.
Although not listed above, one major growth product has been the export of cured bacon.
This has seen annual growth of almost ten percent; in 2003, just under $1 million was exported.
Thailand Thailand has enjoyed rapid economic growth brought about by a wide industrial base that initially started in value-added agricultural goods that has since diversified.
A major component of the economy is tourism, which is seen as a cheap and exotic destination by young people.
The country’s open attitude to business, coupled with ongoing reforms of the fragile banking sector, should make the country extremely conducive to further investment.
This is confirmed by the fact that 40.5 per cent of the labour force is engaged in agriculture but the sector only contributes 13 per cent to GDP.
Thailand’s main production of primary crops is centered on sugar; Thailand is considered the world’s largest exporter.
In 2000, the government proposed increased subsidies to farmers and some debt relief.
To date, however, no action has been taken.9 Other important primary crops include rice, cassava, and rubber.
Because of its abundant natural resources, Thailand has emerged as a large net agri-food and seafood exporter.
In 2003, exports were 9
valued at $14.5 billion USD and imports at $4.6 billion USD, leaving a trade surplus of almost $10 billion USD.
Thai imports (see table 16) are interesting, considering that a significant portion is comprised of seafood products, half of which is various types of frozen tuna.
One area that has seen considerable growth is oilseeds, which is almost completely fuelled by demand for soybeans.
Value is in millions of American dollars.
Canada’s share in this market was 1.8 per cent.
Value is in millions of Canadian dollars.
Canadian trade with Thailand was down in 2003 over previous years, substantially because of lessened wheat exports.
The export of crabs and shrimp constitute more than 30 per cent of Canada’s trade with Thailand.
Viet Nam Viet Nam is ruled by a one-party communist state has moved recently to adopt free(r) market policies.
In July 2000, the first stock market in Viet Nam was opened.
The World Trade Organization hopes
that Viet Nam will accede on schedule in 2005 but significant additional reforms still need to be undertaken.
The reforms that have been enacted so far have undoubtedly helped the country achieve the highest real GDP per capita growth rate in the region.
Much like Thailand, rural poverty is rampant and relies primarily on subsistence farming.
Leading exports to Viet Nam by Canada are almost identical in composition as those to Thailand.
With a liberalizing economy, a larger population, and faster economic growth than Thailand, agri-food and seafood exports to Viet Nam could see large gains.
There are a couple of interesting points.
First, the trends in overall trade versus agri-food trade are completely opposite: in total trade, relative imports are rising while relative exports remain constant, while in agrifood trade, the opposite is true.
Second, intra-ASEAN trade is rising more quickly for agri-food and seafood products than for overall trade.
This may be an indicator that tariff-reducing exercises are increasing regional trade flows, as tariffs and non-tariff barriers are usually higher on agricultural products than other commodity classifications.
Direction of ASEAN Trade Flows 1993 1997 2001 Overall Intra-ASEAN (Imports) 17.4% 18.2% 20.8% Intra-ASEAN (Exports) 21.1% 24.9% 22.7% Intra-ASEAN (Total) 19.2% 21.5% 21.9% Agri-Food & Seafood Intra-ASEAN (Imports) 24.0% 21.8% 22.9% Intra-ASEAN (Exports) 14.7% 21.0% 21.6% Intra-ASEAN (Total) 18.0% 21.3% 22.1% Source:

These numbers are the combined imports and exports reported by six ASEAN members (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) to the then-current ASEAN members.
Thus, there is upward bias in the numbers as the date progresses.
Also, agri-food and seafood is defined simply as the first 24 HS chapters.
Because of common linkages, such as former colonial bonds and similar organizational frameworks, a greater partnership between ASEAN and the EU may have been expected.
Today, however, ASEAN is looking increasing westward as the member countries have realized their overall heavy dependence on Japanese goods and technology and would like to see greater diversification of external suppliers.
For total merchandise Total Value $2.691 bil $2.276 bil exports, the ASEAN region has Share 1.03% 0.60% been a declining region, both Agri-Food Value $0.332 bil $0.506 bil in nominal and relative terms, Share 1.61% 1.76% as displayed in table 20.
ASEAN is a larger market for Canadian agri-food and seafood exports than for any single European nation.
Edward Elgar:
Cheltenham, UK: 1999.
Canada’s largest exports to the region are outlined in table 21.
Half of trade with the region is composed of wheat.
The other leading products are similarly unprocessed products with little value-added.
Much of this can simply be attributed to low incomes and therefore low demand for high-value products.
As the region develops, however, there should be increased demand for more Canadian agri-food and seafood products, especially high-value ones.
Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Philippines January 2007
Philippines Country Report:
Philippines Past, Present & Future Report January 2007 Overview The Philippines, home to almost 88 million residents, is located in the heart of the rapidly developing Southeast Asian region.
Having been under American control from 1898 to 1946, this influence has transformed the Philippines into the most westernized country in the region.
The country boasts a growing consumer market that has developed a strong penchant for North American foods, and ultimately presents great opportunity for Canadian agri-food exporters.
The Philippines has an expanding under-30 population that is increasingly leading a westernized lifestyle, with a growing taste for North American-type packaged, processed and convenience foods.
This nearly 21 million-strong consumer group may become an extremely lucrative target market for Canadian agri-food exporters in the future.
Canada – Philippines Relations Canada and the Philippines maintain excellent bilateral relations.
Canada has provided monetary aid since the mid-1970s and enjoys a strengthening trade relationship with the country that averages $1 billion annually.
Canada has given more than $500 million in development support to the Philippines to date, and continues to donate approximately $25 million each year.
The nations first established diplomatic relations in 1972 and continue to maintain frequent highranking official visits to each other’s states.
The countries currently share trade, development, educational and cultural partnerships.
The Philippines is Canada’s 38th major export market and 36th Philippines Total Trade US$102.8 billion largest source for Canadian Exports US$49.6 billion Imports US$53.2 billion imports.
• Top Canadian exports to the Philippines include copper ores Canada-Philippines Ag Trade $159.4 million and concentrates (18%), meslin Exports $104.6 million and wheat (12%), and lumber Imports $54.8 million (11%).
Agricultural Trade Total agricultural trade between Canada and the Philippines has fluctuated over the past several years, but overall, decreased by 44% from $196 million in 2000 to $159 million in 2005 due to a reduction in Canadian exports.
Bulk and consumer-oriented goods consistently represent the majority of Canadian agri-food exports to the Philippines.
Such goods comprised almost all Canadian agri-food exports in 2005 at 85%.
Canada’s agricultural exports to the Philippines decreased by 44% between 2004 and 2005 mainly due to a large decrease in bulk exports.
Canada currently accounts for 1.7% of the Philippines’ total agri-food imports and is the Philippines’ 14th largest import source for such goods.
Canada’s agri-food imports from the Philippines have steadily increased over the past few years from $48.8 million in 2003 to $52.9 million in 2004, and $54.8 million in 2005.
This rise was largely due to increases in fruit juice mixtures and coconut oil imports between 2003 and 2004, and growth in fruit mixture imports between 2004 and 2005.
Complete statistical summary available at: http://ats.agr.gc.ca/stats/philippines_e.pdf
• Total Canada-Philippines agricultural trade represents approximately 13% or $159.4 billion of all trade between the two countries.
Top Canadian exports to the Philippines in 2005 were wheat totalling $43.4 million and representing approximately 42% of total agri-food exports, chicken and capon cuts at $8.6 million or 8% of total exports, and prepared or preserved potatoes worth over $7.7 million and 7% of exports.
Frozen swine cuts and malt accounted for roughly $5.4 million and $4.1 million respectively, or 5% and 4% of exports.
2005 bulk exports to the Philippines totalled $47.8 million, decreasing by 63% from $131.4 million in 2004, while intermediate exports totalled $15.5 million and showed about 29% growth from 2004.
Consumer oriented exports were valued at $41.2 million in 2005, a $2.2 million or 5% decrease from 2004.
Top Canadian imports from the Philippines in 2005 were dried coconuts valued at over $7.3 million and making up about 13% of all agri-food imports, garlic valued at over $7.2 million or 13% of total imports, and dried guavas, mangoes and mangosteens totalling almost $6.7 million or 12% of such goods.
Other major Canadian agri-food imports included pineapples and coconut oil, worth over $4 million and $2.5 million, or roughly 7% and 5% of total imports respectively.
Economy The Philippines has seen varied economic growth over the past 60 years, having experienced recessions (e.g. most recently the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis) and implemented numerous economy-boosting laws and reforms.
The country has recently made considerable progress in establishing economic stability, although fiscal and social problems remain two of the Philippines’ largest weaknesses.
In order to see sustained economic growth, the Filipino government must implement a high-growth strategy to address the country’s poverty issue.
A high population growth rate and unequal distribution of wealth throughout the country are major contributing factors to the Philippines’ ongoing struggle with poverty.
In fact, the National Capital Region (NCR), situated in Manila, alone is home to 14% of the population and generates one-third of total GDP.
Furthermore, 2001 per capita income in the NCR was estimated at almost nine times that of the poorest region of the Philippines.
Other challenges remain, including widespread corruption, little progress with core fiscal policies, the need for legal reforms, and rising energy prices.
However, the state plans to introduce continued economic reforms in order to help the Philippines remain competitive with the rest of developing Asia.
The government’s strategy includes improving infrastructure, boosting public revenues by strengthening tax collection, tightening fiscal spending, fostering privatization, improving banking sector viability, and increasing trade integration with the Asian region.
Such reforms are expected to counteract economic weaknesses and improve FDI to the Philippines.
The Philippines has drawn in over US$13.5 billion in FDI over the past decade in areas such as information technology, manufacturing, and telecommunications, as well as in service sectors like tourism, consulting, engineering and construction.
Foreign investment levels totalled US$1.1 billion in 2005.
As of July 2006, FDI levels had reached the 2005 year-end value, an approximate 60% increase over the same period in 2005.
The country also heavily relies on the remittances it receives from its estimated eight million overseas Filipino workers; foreign exchange payments equalled US$10.6 billion in 2005 or more than 10% of GDP.
Current economic trends:
Forecasted economic trends:
Inflation is expected to average 5% in 2007 and 2008, down from 6% in 2006.
As Filipinos increasingly lead busier lifestyles, demand for healthier packaged and processed foods is greatly increasing.
Filipinos also enjoy dining outside of the home on a regular basis, often frequenting take-away and fast food outlets, as well as reasonably priced full-service restaurants with family.
Therefore, major opportunities for Canadian agri-food exporters may include offering healthier portable, convenience, and ready-to-eat and -cook foods.
As is the case in many countries, traditional eating habits are modified as cultural and social changes surface.
With the Philippines having seen an influx of Westernstyle fast food chains and products (bolstered by Western lifestyles shown through media) consumers have trended toward purchasing more meals from such outlets and moving away from eating traditional Filipino dishes.
Healthier packaged and ready-to-eat foods, such as breakfast cereals, pasta, margarine and spreads have become increasingly popular.
Consumer expenditure totalled $75.6 billion in 2005, and is expected to rise approximately 27% to reach $96.3 billion by 2015.
Overall spending on less nutritious processed and packaged foods seems to be decreasing as consumers opt for healthier and more affordable value-added options.
Specific agri-food products that hold strong opportunities in the Philippines marketplace include powdered milk; green peas; fresh or dried potatoes, and potato flakes or powder; tomato paste or purée; and fresh, dried and mixed fruit.
Flavouring for ice cream, snack, canned and beverage products; dressings and spreads; cocoa-based products; and fats and oils are also expected to show considerable growth.
Due to extreme differences in the standard of living throughout the Philippines’ urban and rural areas, the following Filipino consumption analysis primarily reflects those consumers living in major urban areas of the country.
General
• Approximately 37% of consumer expenditure was allocated to the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverages in 2005.
• In 2005, consumers spent $28.3 billion on food and non-alcoholic beverages.
This value is expected to increase by 31% to reach $37 billion by 2015.
• Roughly 15% of Filipinos (i.e. 13 million consumers) have enough income to purchase imported food and beverages on a regular basis.
This trend should yield significant long-term import growth if income distribution improves throughout the Philippines.
• More than 60% of the Filipino population (i.e. 52 million consumers) are under the age of 30; many of these urban residents are regular consumers of processed and ready-to-eat foods.
Dining outside of the home is becoming extremely popular with the Philippines’ urban residents, as such consumers increasingly lead busier lifestyles.
• Fish is the most popular fresh food in the Philippines, greatly due to its wide availability for most consumers.
Filipinos consumed an average 86 lb. per capita in 2003, a 6% increase over 1998 levels.
• Red meat remains a staple in most Filipino households despite its higher prices in comparison to poultry and fish.
Filipino consumers are quite price sensitive, and therefore tend to purchase food products that provide the best value for money.
Filipinos consumed an average 9.1 lb. per capita in 2003, a 15% increase over 1998 levels.
This fresh food sector saw 12% growth between 1998 and 2003 and obtained an average 79 lb. per capita consumption in 2003.
Growth in ready-to-drink (RTD) tea followed at 59% and 0.05 L per capita, and fruit and vegetable drinks with a 46% increase and 5.3 L per capita consumption.
Despite growing consumer interest in healthier beverages, carbonates remain the most popular soft drink among Filipinos with 35 L per capita consumption in 2003, a modest 1.4% increase over 1998 levels.
• Lager, white spirits and rum are the most consumed alcoholic drinks in the Philippines.
Combined, these sectors saw an average 133% growth between 1998 and 2003.
• Major supermarket chains operating in the Philippines include Supervalue Inc., SM Mart Inc., Robinsons Supermarket Corp., and Rustan Supermarkets Inc.
There are no internationally-owned supermarkets or hypermarkets in the Philippines.
Supervalue, Inc., SM Mart Inc., and Robinsons Supermarket Corp. target lower- to middle-class consumers who make up approximately 90% of the Filipino population.
Due to Filipinos’ price sensitivity and limited cold and/or freezer storage, products should be made available in smaller quantities, and packaging designed to resist extreme heat and humidity.
Fast food outlets, full-service restaurants, cafés, bars, home delivery and takeaway counters, self-service cafeterias, and food kiosks can all be found in major shopping malls in the Philippines.
In fact, such shopping centres have become more popular for their food retailers than for other shops on-site.
Fast food outlets account for 49% of the $4.1 billion (or 16% of consumer food expenditure) annually spent by consumers on food for consumption outside of the home.
Competitors As a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Philippines relies heavily on its many Asia-Pacific neighbours as import sources, making the country a more challenging market for Canadian products and companies to penetrate.
The Philippines’ principal agri-food import sources, United States (20%), Vietnam (16%), New Zealand (7%), Argentina (6%) and Thailand (6%), represent Canada’s top competition in the Philippines export market.
Other key competitors include Australia, China and European Union (EU) countries.
Access Issues The Philippines remains a destination of constant trade and investment interest for foreign investors, and holds strong potential for Canadian companies wanting to penetrate the Southeast Asian market.
To facilitate successful market entry, Canadian exporters are encouraged to develop market entry strategies that include working with local importers and distributors to develop a presence, gain valuable market advice, and best position products to meet local tastes, laws and pricing.
Logistics are a key consideration when looking to export to the Philippines.
Although the country continues to improve its infrastructure, many distribution networks, specifically roads in and around Manila, remain underdeveloped or highly congested.
The majority of the Philippines’ requirements governing imports are co-ordinated with WTO regulations, while others are specific to the region.
The Philippines does
hold several import regulations which Canadian exporters should be aware of before entering the market:
• Imported products typically face lower tariffs than those that compete with domestically produced goods.
The Value Added Tax (VAT) laws were amended in 2006, increasing the VAT rate to 12% from 10% and reducing VAT exemptions, in order to raise government revenues and in turn, eliminate the fiscal deficit.
It is recommended that Canadian exporters contact the Philippines’ Tariff Commission when checking import duties on individual products at http://www.tariffcommission.gov.ph/. The corporate income tax rate was raised to 35% from 32% in 2005, but is expected to decrease to 30% by 2009.
All bulk agricultural exports must have a sanitary certificate from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) or an appropriate agency.
Processed food and beverage exports need to be registered with the Philippine’s Bureau of Food and Drug.
For more detailed information on customs procedures, documentation, tariffs and labelling requirements consult the International Trade Canada – Trade Commissioner Service http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/ie-en/DisplayDocument.jsp?did=42842.
Business Travel Tips The Philippines’ business customs are similar to those in North America; however, a good understanding of the differences is important for successful market entry.
•
January 2007
The Philippines’ agriculture sector is an integral component of its economy, accounting for 14% of GDP and employing approximately 36% of the population in 2005.
The Philippines’ agricultural industry produced almost $19 billion of goods in 2005, a 5.6% increase over 2004 levels.
Agricultural growth is expected to slow through 2007, due to inclement weather that is forecast for the short term.
Crops accounted for approximately 47% of the 2005 agricultural output, and poultry and livestock comprised 15% and 13% respectively.
Arable land accounts for approximately 19% of total agricultural land, and permanent crops make up 17% of this land.
There are 15,500 sq. km of irrigated land in the Philippines.

Vietnam Past Present & Future Report January 2007 Overview Since Vietnam began its transition towards a market based economy its economic performance has been remarkable.
Over the past 5 years, Vietnam’s growth has been second only to China in the Asian region and many believe that growth could match or exceed China’s if infrastructure development and privatization keep up with economic expansion.
GDP growth is trickling down to the average consumer as average spending power has increased substantially.
Urban consumers have much higher levels of income and are increasingly looking to new retail outlets for new products that meet their evolving lifestyle.
Increasingly, Vietnam is turning to imports to address the growing needs of its ever expanding consumer base.
Canada - Vietnam Relations Canada - Vietnamese relations have been expanding considerably since diplomatic relations were formally established in 1973.
Since 1994, the Canada-Vietnam relationship has developed greatly due in part to a series of high level diplomatic missions by both countries.
This expanding relationship has led to significant increases in bilateral trade, facilitated by a bilateral trade agreement implemented in 1997, an Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation, and an economic cooperation agreement.
Additionally, Vietnam and Canada are both members of La Francophonie which has allowed leaders from both countries to conduct less formal yet fruitful meetings.
Since 2000, bilateral trade between Canada and Vietnam increased from roughly $270 million to reach over $750 million in 2005.
Trade balance ($360 million)
• Canada’s imports from Vietnam were valued at $560 million in Canada - Vietnam Ag Trade 2005 up from $440 million in 2004 Exports $104.6 million Imports $154.4 million and $330 million 2003.
Trade balance ($49.8 million)
• Canada’s imports were comprised of primarily: fish and seafood, cashew nuts, coffee, wooden furniture, garments, footwear, woven apparel, spices, coffee and tea.
Agricultural Trade Traditionally, Vietnam had been a difficult agricultural market to access due to strict import regulations and high duties and tariffs.
However, this import situation, particularly involving agricultural goods, could improve to the benefit of imported consumer goods.
Vietnam is poised to join the WTO as early as the end of 2006.
In order to gain membership, Vietnam has already agreed to remove all agricultural export subsidies, implement a 30% reduction in tariffs over a five-year period and put an end to all export subsidies.
The key staples of the Vietnamese diet (fish and rice) are produced in abundance domestically and have naturally limited agricultural imports in the past.
However, the makeup of agricultural imports is changing as more affluent urban consumers seek more variety and convenience options.
In turn, the processing sector is looking to imports to supply this rapidly expanding industry.
In 2005, Vietnam imported US$3.7 billion worth of agricultural goods.
Vietnam’s primary agricultural import suppliers include China, Australia, Thailand, New Zealand, ASEAN countries, Argentina, the EU and the US.
Key agricultural imports for the consumer sector include dairy, tobacco and grain (wheat), while other major agricultural imports, such as fertilizer, animal feed and pesticides, support Vietnam’s significant agricultural sector.
This was an increase of more than US$70 million over 2003 levels.
Actual import totals continue to be difficult to accurately list as border and reporting issues continue.
Despite impressive growth in consumer-ready imports, bulk commodities continue to dominate the Vietnamese agricultural import market, a trend that will likely continue over the next five years due to three key factors.
• First, high value and processed goods are in very low demand throughout the country.
There are niche markets present, particularly in the country’s two key cities, but a majority of the population is still unable to afford processed or imported goods.
• Second, the government is working very hard to build a viable, modern food processing sector able to process the country’s vast ag-resources and imported bulk items for the domestic and regional market.
Given the country’s success in other ventures of this nature, it is fully expected that the it will succeed.
Vietnam Country Report:
Finally, despite significant growth and expansion in the retail sector, Vietnamese food purchases continue to be made in outdoor, informal wet markets.
Canada Vietnam Agricultural Trade Bilateral agricultural trade between Vietnam and Canada was valued at $259 million, over 40% of total trade.
This was an increase of $90 million over 2004 and $130 million over 2003 levels.
Canada exported $104 million worth of agricultural goods in 2005, an increase of $81 million over 2004 figures.
Canada’s agricultural exports are typically dominated by wheat and 2005 export growth was bolstered by a $69 million increase in wheat exports.
This increase has been carried through 2006 as wheat exports through August have already exceeded $66 million.
Growth in 2005 also came from significant increases in hide and skin exports which grew by more than $10 million over 2004, and seafood exports which increased by almost $3 million over the same period.
Vietnam Country Report:
Rates for 2005 and 2006 exceeded 8%, and 2007 and 2008 projections are in line with the period as a whole at 7.2% and 7.4% respectively.
Much of the country’s growth has come thanks to a rapidly expanding export sector.
Export growth since 1990 has exceeded China’s and Vietnam is now challenging even the most dominant countries in their "Bread and Butter" exports, such as with Brazil and coffee, India and tea, and Thailand and rice.
The truly remarkable aspect of this growth is the trickle down to the general population.
While Vietnam is still one of the Asia’s poorest countries, GDP PPP has tripled since 1990.
The percentage of the population that lives in deep poverty (less than US$1 per day according to the World Bank) has dropped from 50% of the population in 1990 to less than 10% to date.
Secondary school enrollment has doubled during the same period and today over 60% of appropriate aged children are enrolled in secondary school.
Life expectancy has jumped and infant mortality has plunged.
Statistics like these have demonstrated that over 15 years Vietnam has passed India, China and the Philippines in terms of percentages of population living out of poverty.
The country has better life expectancy and infant mortality rates than much richer countries like Thailand, and school enrollment is better than all of the above.
The Vietnamese economy has a number of notable strengths, such as key natural resources including oil reserves and an expanding educated workforce.
• FDI is growing at more than 30% GDP growth 8.4% (2005) 8% (2006e) per year, and is focused in the GDP/ capita US$550 industrial sector and services, particularly hotels and tourism.
• Ho Chi Minh City is the commercial centre of Vietnam.
Vietnam Country Report:
Overall, economic development has not been even.
Urban economies are much stronger than rural.
Urban PPP remains much higher than rural PPP.
Economic disparity is also visible on a province by province basis.
The government continues to be the country’s largest employer.
Industry contributes 41% of the country’s GDP and employs 37% of the labour force.
• GDP growth for 2007 and 2008 is expected to remain at the 7% average of the preceding 10 years.
• Long-term objectives include global economic integration through membership in APEC, ASEAN free trade and the WTO.
One million young Vietnamese enter the workforce every year and one million more Vietnamese move to the cities annually.
Serous issues could arise if jobs dry up.
Recently, Vietnam has benefited from high prices for its key commodities.
Serious drops in any of these categories could negatively affect future growth.
Both sectors are of high importance to the Vietnamese economy in terms of the work force and GDP, and it is unclear how they will perform without protection.
A regional slowdown or worse, an economic bust, would deeply impact this economy.
Privatization while reportedly at the top of the government’s plans for the future has seen politically motivated delays.
Currently only 5% of jobs are in private industry.
Over 70% of banking is controlled by Vietnam’s six state-owned banks and lending practices favour non-performing loans to state-owned enterprises.
Further improvements to the investment environment will be necessary if Vietnam is to become a prime destination for international investment dollars.
Current limitations to foreign ownership and a lack of transparency in internal deals have put off some investors.
•
Disposable income is increasing very quickly and income increases are not yet being erased by higher costs of living.
National per capita GDP is US$550 / GDP PPP is US$3,200.
Ho Chi Minh City is the commercial centre of Vietnam.
GDP growth rates in Ho Chi Minh City are 3% to 4% higher than the national average.
GDP / PPP in the Ho Chi Minh area is reportedly as high as US$9,000.
Modern retail outlets/supermarkets account for roughly 10% of food sales.
Consumers generally shop daily.
General preferences
• Fresh food is preferred and/or required due to daily food shopping habits and low levels of refrigerator ownership.
Fruit is an important component of the Vietnamese diet.
Pork has traditionally been the country’s meat of choice.
Issues with chicken safety have led to supply issues which have opened the door to beef.
While current sales have been limited to high-end consumers (e.g. hotels, restaurants, etc.) beef has been introduced to some of the larger local supermarkets.
Alcohol sales, in particular beer, are growing rapidly.
Vietnam has been described as a "snack-happy" society.
Since imported snacks are subject to some of the highest import rates, Western producers are moving toward domestic production to meet consumer needs and introduce new brands and products.
Consumer confidence in Western products is high and there has been a notable fascination amongst younger consumers with Western-styled goods.
Opportunities
• Dairy products (powder and fresh).
Imports are being targeted at general consumers and the processing industry.
Canada has had success in the past with powder exports.
Imported fresh and canned fruits are growing in popularity, particularly apples and grapes.
Competitors Vietnam’s Southeast Asian neighbours are the dominant food exporters in this market.
Their products are recognized, have the advantage of proximity and price and in some cases can avoid logistical issues by circumventing borders (illegally).
With regards to bulk products and processed goods commonly produced by Canada, competition comes chiefly from Australia and New Zealand.
The EU and the US have also established a strong presence in Vietnam.
Australia and New Zealand have focused a great deal of time and effort advertising and promoting their national foods in the region, in particular Vietnam, and have been rewarded.
In addition, the modern hotels and restaurants in Vietnam are dominated by Australian and European managers and chefs who have shown a preference for their home products.
Access Issues Overview With WTO accession on the horizon the access picture in Vietnam should improve considerably.
Processed goods face import tariffs from 20% to 50% while alcoholic beverages faces 65% import tariffs.
Food import requirements, particularly animal imports, can be lengthy and difficult.
January 2007
Foreigners are not permitted to import or distribute food in Vietnam.
Legal issues can be very complex, a local lawyer is considered essential.
Only 15 years ago Vietnam was a net importer of food, while today the country has become one of the world's largest exporters of rice and coffee.
Tea exports continue to rise and pepper, nuts and spices are all major international exports.
Even more impressive has been the recent performance of the fisheries industry.
Rice and coffee account for about half of agricultural export revenues.
The agricultural sector’s share of the overall economy continues to shrink in the face of the performance of the industrial sector; however, farmer harvests continue to grow and exports are on the rise.
The government has openly emphasized this great importance to the national economy of developing this sector.
Agriculture employs roughly 60% of Vietnam's workforce, farm products account for over 50% of the country's income, and 55% of all of its exports are related to the agricultural, fisheries or food processing industries.
Used and low cost machinery is common and there continues to be a demand for innovative, cost-effective production techniques which improve efficiency and productivity, but do not require large investments in capital equipment.
Many economists and policy makers seek solutions for Vietnam's rural sector where the overwhelming proportion of the population lives and works.
Crop diversification, rural industrialization, increased farm size, greater mechanization, application of science and technology, and diversification of crops are all ideas for greater growth and further poverty reduction in rural areas.
Food safety, both for domestic and export markets, is an increasingly important issue in Vietnam, but overall standards continue to lag behind Western levels.
Demand will increase for technologies in production, processing and storage facilities.

Economy- Overview Thailand is an industrializing country that has moved away from a traditional agrarian economy towards an export-oriented, service based economy.
However, the Thai economy still relies heavily upon agriculture as it consumes little foreign capital and contributes greatly to foreign earnings.
The Thai economy has experienced sustained growth between 3% and 4% over the past six years.
The IMF has backed the government of Thailand’s economic initiatives with a US$17.2 billion package.
The growth of the Thai economy has been tied directly to growth in exports.
In the period between 1997 and 2002 exports increased by 19.6% with the industry sector growing by 5.2%, services growing by 3.8%, and agriculture growing by 1.2%.
However, weak domestic demand between 1997 and 2002 forced the Thai government to reduce interest rates and run a low fiscal deficit.
Economy - Current Situation The solid GDP growth of 5.4% achieved in 2002 carried through into 2003 which achieved 6.7% for the year.
Industrial sector growth was fueled by growth in manufacturing and contributed 4.2 percentage points to GDP growth.
Stronger economic growth meant that the unemployment rate continued to fall.
After averaging 2.4% in 2002, it averaged 2.2% in 2003, the lowest rate since 1997.
However, the incidence of poverty remains a concern.
The Government is dealing with it through a fiscal spending program and an unemployment security fund to provide a safety net for those laid off.
The government has launched a "war on poverty" in an attempt to eradicate poverty within 6 years.
Faster economic expansion also strengthened the fiscal position from a deficit of 2.2% in 2002 to surplus of 0.6% in 2003.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 1.8% in 2003 from 0.7% in 2002, but remains manageable.
The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, edged up by just 0.2%.
The monetary policy of the Bank of Thailand (BOT) is aimed at maintaining core inflation within a 0-3.5% range.
Thailand paid off the last of the IMF-arranged loan package in July 2003, 2 years ahead of schedule.
Soon after this, the Government announced that it would no longer borrow from multilateral sources.

30 years of age.
The importance of the Thai restaurant, hotel and catering services sector is growing.
Thailand is one of the top tourist destinations in the area.
High growth in the number of hotels, resorts and other tourist accommodations continues to lead to an increase in the number of imported food items to support more tourists.
Hotels and international restaurants play an important role in increasing consumer awareness about products, which may not be commonplace in the retail market.

Economy - Forecast GDP growth for all of 2004 is estimated at 7.2%, moderating in 2005 to just above 6%.
These numbers take into account any fallout from the Avian Flu outbreak.
Exports are likely to accelerate in 2004 assuming currency appreciation is held in check and assuming global economic conditions continue to improve.
Planned increases in government investment in 2004 and the government pledge to eliminate poverty should help to boost growth.
Growth in private consumption spending, a large factor in GDP growth for the past two years, should continue at 6% in 2004.
Farm incomes should increase with the higher prices of major crops.
Exports of electronics, plastics products, and vehicles have so far increased by 21% with imports of intermediate goods and raw materials increasing by roughly 25%.
Consumer Market Domestic spending and a rebound in exports bolstered the renewed growth that occurred in 2003.
Recently, Thai living in urban areas have become relatively brand conscious and their shopping behaviour has moved away from the traditional open-air wet markets to modern supermarkets and shopping centers which offer them convenience and a wide selection of products in a modern experience.
Changing eating habits of Thais are greatly benefitting the restaurant sector in Thailand.
Continuous increases in the number of health-conscious consumers is leading to higher demand for health and functional food and drinks.
Consumers are also eating out more frequently.
Upper and middle-income groups in Thailand like to spend money on food, especially during the holidays.
Consumption of imported food products
The products with the best sales potential are seafood, meats, nuts, baking products, breakfast cereals, canned foods, dairy products, fresh fruit and vegetables, frozen products, fruit juice, and alcoholic beverages.
Thailand has recently become a promising market for bull semen with imports valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Thai farmers are utilizing this import as an inexpensive way to upgrade the genetics of the existing domestic cattle herds.
The Thailand’s biotech policy mirrors that of Thailand's main trading partners Europe and Japan.
To keep in line with Japan and the EU, research is being conducted to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides, improve yield and reduce crop losses.
It is expected that future Thai decisions regarding biotech importation and production will continue to follow the standards set by Japan and the EU.
Thailand accounts for roughly 1% of total global trade.
Agriculture Thailand is a key regional agricultural producer with the capability to produce far more than it's population can consume.
As a result, the agri-food sector is a key component of international trade.
Thai agri-food exports exceed their imports by a broad margin.
Thailand's agri-food sector employs roughly 60% of the population.
The primary food crops produced are bananas, barley, cocoa beans, coconuts, coffee, maize, potatoes, rice, soybeans, sugar cane and wheat.
The primary livestock products are beef, chicken, duck, goose, lamb and pork.
Thailand is the world's largest exporter of rubber, canned pineapple and fresh orchids.
Thailand is also one of the world's largest seafood producers with valuable exports of frozen fish and shrimp.
However, 2004 anti-dumping tariffs on Thai shrimp entering the US will probably reduce Thai seafood exports in the coming months.
It is also estimated that Thai rice and tapioca account for 25% and 85% of world exports respectively.
The mining sector accounts for 3.8% of exports and 14.4% of imports.
Many of these countries are its major trade partners, accounting for more than 50% of total international trade value.
Thailand's foreign policy includes support for ASEAN in the interest of regional stability.
The country has developed increasingly close ties with other ASEAN members--Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Burma (Myanmar), and Vietnam.
Regional cooperation is progressing in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters.
As part of its effort to increase international ties, Thailand has reached out to such regional organizations as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
Hypermarkets, large supermarkets, have been hugely successful in Thailand.
Thailand features a growing retail industry which is looking for new imported food products.
To differentiate Canadian products from Thai products, firms should emphasize their strengths in quality, innovation, and safety.
It is recommended that all Canadian exporters visit the Thai market to conduct research, especially for product testing, price comparison, adjusting the product for local tastes and determining government regulations.
Canadian exporters must provide reliable product availability, consistently supplying a quality product, technical support, and information support.
Your business should match your export volume capabilities to the sale volume capabilities of the retail channel.
Product advertisement is very important in the Thai market.
In Thailand, advertising on television is the most popular and commands 64 %, newspapers 18%, radio 10%, magazine 5%, outdoor billboards 3%, and others 3%.
Thailand's high tariff structure remains a major market access impediment.
Even though the rates will decline by 33 to 50 % under the WTO, most items will remain in the 30 to 40 % range by the year 2005.
However, raw materials used in the food processing industry, which are not available locally, may be imported with low tariffs.
Market Access Distribution and sales of industrial goods in Thailand are normally conducted through two
proven to be a successful option for many foreign businesses.
In addition to high duties, other Thai policies continue to impose tough barriers on imports of products.
The Thai government has identified key areas of focus for future foreign investment.
The Thai agriculture industry is also currently seeking additional foreign investment.
Public investment declined in the first half of the year before recovering in the second, resulting in overall growth in total investment of 11.7%, approaching double the 6.5% recorded in 2002.
Semichemical wood pulp exports were at $27 million, up a strong 33% from 2002, while wheat exports to Thailand dropped to $21 million down 44% from 2002 The top five imports from Thailand to Canada are Computers at $204 million, up 30% from their 2002 levels.
Video and television equipment export values rose to $129 million, up a solid 7% with live crustacean imports decreasing 15% to $133 million.
Prepared crustaceans were exported at a value of $79 million, up 12% from 2002.

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Singapore April 2007
Singapore Country Report:
Singapore Past, Present & Future Report April 2007 Overview Singapore is an island city-state with an exceptional infrastructure, stable political environment, and advanced economy.
Commercially and financially, Singapore is one of the most highly developed countries in the world.
The country is very prosperous and boasts a per capita GDP that is on par with Western Europe’s leading nations.
With limited space for large domestic production, Singapore is highly trade-dependent and possesses one of the busiest ports in the world, second only to Hong Kong.
Singapore also plays a significant role in Southeast Asia, acting as a major gateway to other countries in the area, and is the financial and technological center of the region.
The country’s 4.4 million consumer market has developed a strong penchant for North American foods, especially wholesome, organic and convenience food products.
This trend ultimately presents great opportunity for Canadian agri-food exporters looking to enter the Southeast Asian marketplace.
Canada-Singapore Relations Singapore is an active member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a strong advocate for regional growth and development, and a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
Canada is a dialogue partner of ASEAN and has long been involved in development co-operation in the region.
Canada-ASEAN political and trade ties are quite strong.
Over the years, official development assistance from Canada to ASEAN countries has reached a total of $2.58 billion.
As one of APEC’s founding members, Canada is very active within the organization and has a history of promoting trade liberalization and facilitation initiatives.
Legal and regulatory systems are transparent, no equity is required to establish a business in Singapore, and there are little, or no, foreign ownership or control restrictions.
Foreign firms are present in nearly all economic sectors of Singapore, with the industrial sector largely dominated by foreign multinationals.
A significant amount of information sharing and
project collaboration occurs between Canada and Singapore in the areas of science, technology, and research and development (R&D).
Canada and Singapore are currently negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement.
This Imports $979.9 million Trade balance ($241.3 million) value increased by 6% from its 2005 Canada-Singapore Ag Trade $43.0 million total of $1.6 billion.
Exports $29.3 million
Agricultural Trade Although total agricultural trade between Canada and Singapore has fluctuated over the past several years, it has increased by 37%, from $31.3 million in 2000 to over $43 million in 2006.
Intermediate and consumer-oriented goods consistently represent the majority of Canada’s exports, comprising almost 80% of Canada’s agricultural and agri-food exports to Singapore in 2006.
These changes were largely due to increases in shelled cashew nuts and pasta imports between 2004 and 2005, and reductions in the same product imports between 2005 and 2006.
Pasta has remained Canada’s top import commodity from Singapore over the past decade and typically accounts for about 27% of total agri-food imports respectively.
Although Singapore is a large exporter, agriculture and agri-food comprises a small portion of its total exports due to the country’s small size and minimal agricultural industry.
Top Canadian exports to Singapore in 2006 were soya beans totalling $6.9 million and representing approximately 24% of total agri-food exports, wheat at $3.5 million or 12% of total exports, and prepared or preserved potatoes worth over $2.8 million and 9% of exports.
Frozen swine cuts and food preparations each accounted for roughly $1.4 million, or 5% of exports respectively.
2006 bulk exports to Singapore totalled $10.6 million, increasing by 34% from $7.9 million in 2005, while intermediate exports decreased to $4.6 million, a 242% decline from the 2005 value of $13.3 million.
Consumer oriented exports were valued at $13.6 million in 2006, an $800,000 or 5% decrease from 2005.
Singapore’s continual establishment of free trade agreements (FTA) are expected to further growth and create new opportunities for the country, as such accords improve market access and encourage foreign investment.
In order to maintain its market competitiveness and hold its position as a primary gateway to Southeast Asia, the Singaporean government continues to exercise an
Research and development has been cited a national priority with $3.8 billion planned to be spent in the area between 2006 and 2010.
Singapore has drawn in over US$82 billion in FDI over the past five years in such knowledge-based and hi-tech areas as information and communication technology, electronics, business and financial services, chemicals, biomedical sciences, logistics, other service sectors.
Foreign investment levels totalled US$9.3 billion in 2006 with more than 7,000 multinationals, mostly from the United States, Japan, United Kingdom, Germany and India, operating in the country.
• Singapore’s unemployment rate was approximately 3.6% in 2006.
• GDP growth is forecast to slow to 4.5% in 2007 from its 7.9% rate in 2006.
Consumer Market Singapore is labelled the culinary capital of the Southeast Asian region and eating is colourfully called a national pastime, presenting major opportunities for Canadian agrifood exporters.
Strong economic growth in recent years has increased consumer incomes and in turn bolstered the already successful Singaporean foodservice and retail sectors.
As Singaporeans increasingly lead busier lifestyles, traditional meal preparation and dining at home with family is commonly shifting to meals being enjoyed at restaurants.
Singapore’s "food paradise" boasts numerous foodservice outlets that
feature cuisine from around the world, making it simple for consumers to affordably dine outside of the home on a regular basis, often at least once a day.
In fact, due to their affordability, it is not uncommon to see families dine each evening at the nearest neighbourhood street kiosk.
Due to this overall trend toward health-consciousness, Singaporeans are now opting for more expensive organic foods.
This focus on health consciousness is expected to generate an increase in the number and popularity of organic foodservice outlets in Singapore in the future.
Home to a 660,000 Muslim population, the Singaporean market also holds considerable opportunity for halal food manufacturers.
Singapore’s Muslim consumers account for roughly 15% to 20% of total foodservice sales and engage in higher per capita spending than any other consumer group in the country.
As a result, more and more foodservice operators are obtaining halal certification in order to target this increasingly affluent and lucrative consumer segment.
Many of such outlets are seeing an average 20% to 30% increase in sales upon receiving certification, and include food operators with Western, Thai, Korean, Japanese, Mediterranean and Turkish cuisines.
This may present considerable opportunity for Canadian halal food exporters looking to enter the Singaporean market and/or further expand their business into other neighbouring Muslim markets such as the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Consumer expenditure totalled $51.3 billion in 2005, and is expected to rise approximately 37% to reach $70.5 billion by 2015.
Overall spending on less nutritious food and beverages seems to be decreasing as consumers become more health conscious, with healthier food options making up the bulk of such goods being purchased.
A decrease in the consumption of carbonated soft drinks, canned meat and meat products, and margarine in recent years of 15%, 18% and 12% respectively exemplifies this trend.
Specific agri-food products that hold strong opportunities in the Singaporean marketplace include high-quality ready-made meals and frozen foods (e.g. seasoned meats and poultry dishes); diced vegetables; fresh fruit; soup; tree nuts; dairy products; fruit and vegetable juices; chilled and shelf-stable desserts, and ice cream; biscuits and sweet and savoury snacks; and pet food.
In 2005, consumers spent $6.4 billion on food and non-alcoholic beverages.
This value is expected to increase by 11% to reach $7.1 billion by 2015.
Approximately 58% of total food expenditure goes toward food for consumption outside of the home, reflecting the popularity of dining from a wide selection of world cuisines.
As Singapore’s residents increasingly lead busier lifestyles, the demand for safe processed foods and convenience products, as well as healthy and organic foods is rising.
• Fish is widely consumed in Singapore with consumption averaging 158 lb. per capita in 2003, a 17% increase over 1998 levels.
Fish and seafood consumption is expected to continue to show large gains as consumers opt for healthier foods.
Red meat is the most popular meat in Singapore with an average 23 lb. per capita consumed in 2003.
However, poultry, particularly chicken, is becoming increasingly popular with an average 17 lb. per capita consumed in 2003, a 26% increase over 1998 levels.
Eggs are also popular in Singapore with approximately 228 units per capita consumed in 2003, a 5% increase over 1998 levels.
With a push for healthier foods, consumption of vegetables has greatly increased in recent years.
Between 1998 and 2003, per capita consumption of green vegetables rose by almost 16% to reach 160 lb. per capita, and the popularity of tomatoes grew 20% to 50 lb. per capita.
Growth in fruit and vegetable juice followed at 44% and 16 L per capita, bottled water at 39% and 7.9 L per capita, and functional drinks with a 22% increase and 3.3 L per capita consumption.
Retail
• Singapore’s residents typically shop once a week at supermarkets for groceries, and visit convenience stores and small, independent retailers in-between weekly grocery orders.
However, open markets are still common for daily fruit and vegetable purchases at lower prices.
Major supermarket chains operating in Singapore include Carrefour, Giant, Cold Storage, NTUC Fair Price, and Shop N Save.
Supermarkets are increasingly offering 24-hour shopping in response to Singaporeans leading busier lifestyles and their need for more flexible shopping times.
Furthermore, consumers are willing to pay more for such added convenience.
Full-service restaurants account for 43% of the $3.7 billion (or 25% of consumer food expenditure) annually spent by consumers on food for consumption outside of the home.
Competitors As an APEC and ASEAN member, Singapore relies heavily on its many association partners as import sources, making the territory a more challenging market for Canadian products and companies to penetrate.
Singapore’s principal agri-food import sources, Malaysia (18.7%), France (11.6%), Australia (9.2%), Indonesia (8.1%) and China (8.1%), represent Canada’s top competition in the Singaporean export market.
To facilitate successful market entry, Canadian exporters are encouraged to develop market entry strategies that include working with local importers and distributors to develop a presence, gain valuable market advice, and best position products to meet local tastes, laws and pricing.
Singapore’s excellent infrastructure makes the country an attractive export destination for many foreign exporters.
The nation boasts a strategic location at the centre of international shipping routes, and acts as a major trans-shipment point to other Southeast Asian markets.
The country’s roadways also connect to neighbouring markets Malaysia and Thailand.
Home to a world-class port system, one of the leading cargo airports, well-developed highway and transit systems, and advanced IT and telecommunication sectors, Singapore remains one of the best connected countries worldwide.
In addition, the more than 3,000 logistics and supply-chain-management (SCM) companies operating in the country further facilitate the logistics of exporting to Singapore.
In addition to the WTO, APEC and ASEAN, Singapore is member of the UN and Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), and implements international accords and policies from these bodies.
• Singapore is virtually a duty-free port and does not apply tariffs or quotas to food commodities.
However, taxes on liquor, tobacco and tobacco products do apply.
It is recommended that Canadian exporters contact Singapore Customs when checking import duties on such individual products at www.customs.gov.sg.
• A customs permit is also required from Singapore Customs for each shipment of food products.
Exporters can apply for the permit via the customs authority’s TradeNet System.
Approximately 99% of customs permits are approved through this system within 48 hours.
• A 5% goods and service tax (GST) rate is applied on the costs, insurance and freight (CIF) of all imported agri-food products and beverages.
• The Food Control Division (FCD) of the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) oversees food safety, licensing, inspection and import control.
Processed food and beverage exports to Singapore need to be registered with the FCD.
• Singaporeans prefer to first develop a personal relationship on which to later build a business connection.
Singaporeans are, however, more formal than Canadians and typically use their family names during introductions.
Note that many Chinese Singaporeans have a European and Chinese name (with the Chinese name following the surname), e.g. Andrew Tan Yew Meng, but usually only use their family names during introductions (e.g. Mr. Tan).
Accept and offer business cards with both hands, and make sure to study them for a few seconds before putting them carefully away.
Note that approximately 77% of Singapore’s population is Chinese, 14% Malaysian, and 7% Indian, and each of these segments maintains their respective culture and customs.
Furthermore, the country’s Muslim population abstains from eating pork or drinking alcohol, and strict Buddhists and Hindus do not eat beef.
English and Mandarin are widely spoken, with English considered the language of administration and international business in Singapore.
Malay and Tamil are also common in Singapore.
Singaporeans do not always bring up problems or negative responses in conversation as it may "offend".
Therefore, one should pay careful attention to their counterparts’ body language as they may not openly express their concerns.
Private sector business hours generally run from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturday.
Furthermore, with arable land only accounting for a mere 1.47% of total agricultural land, and permanent crops comprising this entire amount, the country’s agricultural sector is essentially nonexistent.

Market Overview Vietnam's stable growth over the past decade has had a positive impact on consumer spending power, resulting in nascent demand for imported and non-traditional agri-food products.
A new emerging class of higher-income, younger and more westernized consumers is readily apparent.
Food distribution patterns are also changing, with supermarkets expanding in the urban areas.
At the same time, Vietnam will remain interested in imported commodities, including wheat and canola.
Vietnam imported about $628 million(1) of food and beverages in 2001, mostly from the EU, New Zealand, Australia, China and the United States.
The total market size of imported agri products in Vietnam is estimated at $1.41 billion (2000) and $2.04 billion (2001).
Opportunities While local produce tends to be competitive and of good quality, Vietnamese processed foods are generally of a lower standard.
There is increasing investment in domestic production of foreign-branded items.
Processed food items originate from all over the world, and achieve success due to a number of factors: price, brand identification, and store promotions.

Key Participants Vietnam produces the majority of its daily food requirements.
Dairy products are dominated by France (joint-venture production), New Zealand and Australia (low-cost imports).
Beer is mostly local JV production, including brands from Singapore, Philippines, Denmark and Netherlands; imports are highly taxed, although there is some tariff concession with the U.S. Bilateral Trade Agreement.
The bottled water market is dominated by local production, much of it foreign-invested.
The limited market for frozen or chilled meat (mostly beef or lamb) is dominated by New Zealand and Australia.
Other processed foods can be found from all over the world, including Asia, Europe and elsewhere.
Private- And Public-Sector Customers The local supermarket chains (Saigon Co-op, Maximark, Citimart, Metro Cash & Carry) and trading firms are the major importers.
Market Access Considerations Vietnam is a country that is undergoing a significant transition toward a modern market economy.
However, the market is still limited by a number of factors, such as:
• tariff rates that are high even by regional standards, for processed food and beverage products, notably for those products where there is local production;
• a price-competitive environment for most products;
• a consumer market that is susceptible to intense marketing (Vietnam has high television penetration, but promotion is difficult due to a lack of market size for many products); and
• a lack of familiarity with some products in which Canadian processing is particularly strong (outlets such as fast food franchises are very limited).
Shipping costs to Vietnam are higher than to other countries in the region, and are a particular impediment for Canadian products.
Vietnam has applied for the World Trade Organization (WTO), and Canada has initiated bilateral discussions toward reducing and binding some food tariffs.
Canada is one of the few countries to have finalized arrangements for veterinary certification for several livestock and meat products (in 2002).

Executive Summary The following report is an analysis of the demand for slaughter line and meat processing equipment in Vietnam.
As well, upstream supply lines, from feed to farms, are moving from household production to an agro-industrial model with corresponding increases in efficiency.
Interviews with executives in the Red River Delta and the Mekong Delta regions revealed that current and planned equipment investments are estimated at approximately $106.3 million (USD$70 million).
This investment only includes interviewed firms, indicating that the market is in fact much larger.
The demand for equipment ranges is split between smaller, lower volume equipment and turnkey facilities to fully and semi-automated sub-production lines (slaughter line to value-added processing) There is also strong demand for packaging equipment.
Most interviewed firms have clearly defined growth plans, largely based on internal capital resources or substantial equity with financing.
It remains to be determined if these plans are going to be effective, especially to meet international production standards.
Nevertheless, the new industry catch-words are "standards and hygiene."
Some of this is focused on interest in overseas markets with phyto-sanitary standards rather than on Vietnam's market.
This significant investment is in response to the limited production capacity of slaughter line and meat processing firms and the rising consumption of fresh meat and processed meat products.
The background to these investment plans is the increase in the consumption of meat in from 17.9 kg to 22.5 kg per capita/year from 1995 to 1999.
Recent estimates place current consumption at 25 kg per capita/year.
Government forecasts estimate consumption will rise to 35 kg by 2010(1).
This significant potential demand should be qualified by the fact that questionable statistical gathering methods in Vietnam and the necessity for a conservative reading of the market.
Nevertheless, rising retail prices for pork are indicative of the growing demand.
Government policies strongly encourage investment in agro-processing technology, with access to subsidized loans or loan guarantees.
The specific investment outlays have yet to be determined for this program although interviewed executives stated that access to this investment capital will be competitive and based on market principles.
These policies are also supported by pork export incentive programs.
Furthermore, Vietnamese firms will face domestic competitive pressure in 2006 when the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement enters into force and import taxes on processed meat products falls from 20-30% to 5%.
A stable competitive equipment market with defined firm market share has not yet developed; nevertheless, competition is increasing and gaining a foothold in the market will require determined efforts on the part of Canadian slaughter line and meat processing equipment manufacturers.
Regional and international firms who have already entered this market are now focusing on consolidation of existing markets, and expansion to take advantage of the significant opportunities.
Market Overview Introduction:
Emerging Market Demand The meat processing sector (primarily pork) is entering a period that can be characterized as an emerging market - firms are beginning to make substantial investments in production technology.
The growth in domestic consumption markets and expanding export markets have reached a level that calls for more substantial capital investment.
Mechanized processing equipment is non-existent (primarily manual slaughtering), or not reliable nor efficient, and production sub-processes are not efficiently engineered.
Initial investments in the late 1990s for freezer lines, and a few stand-alone machines (such as de-hairing) are worn out, or of low production capacity.
More importantly, most firms are undergoing a transition from manual to mechanized production.
The focus of the majority of interviewed executives is to improve slaughter line production standards and consolidate current markets, and to further expand into value-added meat products (sausages and cooked meats), and other types of meat processing (chicken and beef).
There is awareness that entire production processes need to be re-engineered, focusing on key hygiene requirements.
Demand is high for international standard production equipment and food technology engineering, complete with service and maintenance.
This demand for quality and service is in response to the poor performance of foreign rebuilt or inexpensive equipment, purchased during the early to mid-1990s.(3)
The ongoing expansion of retail outlets, supermarkets and fast food franchises are also fueling the demand for processed meats.
As well, consumption of local food products is growing with the surge of foreign tourism arrivals.
Industry executives are getting to know the most important factors for accessing export markets.
Most firms are aware of the necessity to strive towards international standards and significantly improve production processes.
"Standards and Hygiene" are becoming the new industry catch-words.
Growth in exports continues to be limited by the lack of stable veterinary Treaties or other agreements that act as barriers for exports.
Russia is the only country having full veterinary treaty status with Vietnam.
Canada has recently agreed on veterinary certificates for nine meat and livestock products, but the focus of these agreements was more to secure access to Canadian genetic material, rather than to establish market access for Vietnamese products in the Canadian market (a much longer-term proposition).
Specific Growth Plans of Vietnamese companies Most local companies have clearly defined growth plans, largely based on internal capital resources or substantial equity with financing.
Considering these companies' current revenues, as well as the very low cost of production, capital is available for investing in equipment.
Overview:
The Structure Of The Meat Processing Sector Structure According to industry analysts, there are approximately 290 slaughterhouses in Vietnam.
The majority of these firms are present or former state companies and many of these firms are not market competitive.
A significant number of these firms are perishing or are likely to perish as more efficient firms responding to market forces, overtake take their present minor market share, and state subsidies become less available due to competitive market forces for investment capital(5).
Regulatory standards have yet to influence the structure of this sector.
The competitive meat processing industry can be divided into four levels based on volume of production, management sophistication and relative geographic coverage and span:
A first level is made of three major, state-owned integrated firms:
• Ha Long Canned Foods Joint Stock Listed Company; and
These companies own a combination of slaughterhouses, processing plants, and refrigeration facilities in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Danang and Haiphong (the latter only for Ha Long Canned Foods).
VISSAN is the only company that is fully integrated from feedlots to retail outlets.
It has been stated that Animex plants are of the few plants in Vietnam that comply with international hygiene standards (only three of the total in Vietnam meet international standards,(6) although this could not be verified during the field research activities.(7)) These three firms employ upwards of 1000 employees each.
Markets are both domestic and export.
Production at each is above 50,000 tonnes per year.
The second level of companies is made up of firms producing between 5000 and 50,000 tonnes per year.
The third level is made up of approximately 20 to 30 slaughterhouse and meat processing firms.
These firms are predominantly focused on slaughter and freeze, and more recently pig farming to lock in supply lines.
Downstream value added is just beginning, such as cooked and sliced pork for the retail market.
These companies are concentrated in:
• The City of Haiphong and the surrounding Red River Delta provinces; and
• HCMC and surrounding region.
These firms employ on average between 100 and 200 employees.
An important factor to note is that according to industry executives, there are more firms than are widely known but these firms operate as trading companies.
These second tier firms produce from 1000 to 5000 tonnes per year for both the domestic (especially wholesale), and export markets.
According to industry analysts, the firms in the fourth tier number "in the hundreds".
These firms are involved in a much broader range of activities, from slaughtering to value-added production such as processed and fresh cooked meats for almost exclusively, local markets.
The city of Haiphong alone was stated as having over 20 small companies involved in these activities(9).
These firms are best characterized as family businesses.
Most of these firms produce well below 1000 tonnes per year, while value-added processing firms produce less than 10 tonnes per year.
Meat Processing Equipment Lines According to factory research and inspection, mechanized slaughter line meat processing equipment is evident in the stages of production noted below.
It should be noted that the majority of this equipment is old, of low productivity and in need of upgrading, with the exception of new meat processing firms catering to the high income market(10).
The majority of these firm's production processes or equipment do not meet international equipment standards for certification(11).
The following table is to provide a general picture of the equipment lines.

Production Process Development Once again, there is significant demand for slaughter line and meat processing equipment, as well as well as the capital to pay for it.
Improved technology is the key to overcoming the current constraints.
Currently, the industry is characterized as being unhygienic, from animal slaughtering, to meat processing and the meat distribution system.
These executives are also getting to know the correct equation for the growth and development of their firms, and general opportunities and challenges in the sector.
BLCA field interview
Future Processing Equipment Growth Specific investment projects are divided to the scale of production.
With the exception of VISSAN, most investment focuses on semi-mechanization.
These range from full-scale turnkey packages to single item units, such as a small sausage machine.
The growth is divided between scale and production processes.
Big scale - Turnkey Packages for Factory production
• Modest investment of $1.5 million (USD$1 million) to large multi-plant investments of $60.7 million (USD$40 million).
• There is the significant potential for turnkey packages.
The market for this equipment is limited to the top tier producers.
Medium to Small Scale - Production Sub-Process Equipment:
Medium to small-scale production processes are primarily targeted at firms producing upwards of 5000 tonnes per year(13).
These companies are characterized by a relative lack of awareness in available technology, although capital is not regarded as an impediment.
This reflects the market as being "early stage", as well as the limited numbers of technical exchanges following Vietnam's diplomatic isolation (the US embargo only being lifted in 1995), former reliance on East Bloc technology, and former lack of resources.
The following equipment is needed:
• Kill Floor Equipment: potential CO2 or stunning equipment, mechanical moving equipment;
• Mechanical de-hairing machinery, scalding, wash and animal preparation equipment (hygiene) prior to slaughtering;
• Conveyors and cutting line technology;
• Secondary processing technology such as grinders, mixers, blenders and moving equipment;
• Hygiene and safety systems;
• Value added processes such as smokehouse technology, sausage making machines and others.
• Chicken and beef processing equipment.
Small Scale - Stand-Alone Equipment There is a broad demand for small-scale stand-alone equipment.
The critical factor for demand for this equipment is the price level for different production processes.
Stated needs are for small cutters, grinders and mixers, sausage making machinery and other processed meats.
This market is very difficult to aggregate with accuracy.
To determine the demand for equipment would clearly require more comprehensive equipment and market research.
Specific Investment Projects Due to the brevity of analysis, not all firms' investment plans are listed.
Given the general demand in the industry, most firms are currently looking at new equipment, or will be in the near future.
Interviewed firm executives stated the following list.
Company Investment Potential (USD) Equipment Haiphong Food Processing 1-3 million Expand production to include beef slaughter and processing, improve existing slaughter line technology, expand to value added production with a capacity of 3 to 5 tons/day.
Pressing investment concern.
Background To The Demand For Meat Processing Equipment Domestic Consumption Demand Increasing economic prosperity in Vietnam has a direct relationship to the growth in food consumption and correspondingly demands for meat processing.
Average annual meat consumption per capita increased approximately from 17.9 kg to 22.5 kg from 1995 to 1999.
(Accurate and unbiased statistics are notoriously difficult to obtain in Vietnam; almost certainly the consumption rates have been increasing by 10% per annum since then).
The share of commercial feed consumption has increased from 1% to 27% in the same period of time.
The demand for commercial feed is increasing, while prices are falling; an important indicator that markets are becoming more efficient.
Foreign investment has been coming into this sector and this growth in animal feed is anticipated to continue as current demand is approximately 2-3 million tons/year while supply is limited to only 1.5 million tons/year.
Danish Embassy, 2001
Increasing supply of meat, especially pork Overall, the meat industry is currently outputting from 1.7 to 1.9 million tonnes per year: 77% pork, 16% poultry and 7% cattle and buffalo.
As well, the off- take rate has increased by close to 7% annually.
At 5.9%, the growth rate was faster in the first half of the decade (1990-1994), compared to 3.5% from 1995-1998.
Animal weight has increased from 59 kg to 68 kg/head.
The number of buffalo, which are primarily used as draught animals, are declining.
Cattle herds stand at 4 million head in total, 40% of which are used for work.
Herd and the annual off-take (measured in live weight) have grown at 5-6 % since 1990.
Since 1995, the annual growth rate has slowed to 3%.
Most farms are small, having five animals or less.
Southern Vietnam has most of the large farms and high quality pigs in Vietnam.
Five percent of pig herds are being reared on an agro-industrial model, having genetically improved varieties and commercial feeds.
The second grouping of farms that produce 10% of the national herd(18) are mid-sized farms with approximately 100 pigs.
These farms are in the process of switching to agro-industrial models and in the near future will be a significant engine for the growth of supply.
Seventy percent of pork is sold fresh onto the market and the remaining 30% is processed.
Several processing firms also stated that they would like to import frozen Canadian pork.
The main obstacle for increasing exports, after high production costs, is the lack of bilateral veterinary agreements.
Russia (CIS) is the only country with bilateral veterinary treaties.
China, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea and Japan have only issued temporary licenses.
In general, another obstacle is the lack of export finance facilities available to companies, either from government sources or from commercial banks.
Government Policies Encouraging Signs The most common complaint among firm executives was the lack of pro-active government policies to encourage the animal husbandry and meat processing sectors.
This attitude began to change in 2001 as new policies focused on the agro-processing industry were passed:
• On 2 January 2001, the Prime Minister of Vietnam has signed the Decision No. 02/2001/QD-TTg to provide policies for financial assistance to the agro-processing sector.
According to this Decision, agro-processing firms may get up to 90% of total investment from the Development Assistance Fund (DAF).
DAF also provides guaranty of 100% loan value to these firms in case they can get loans or financing from other sources.
• Decision 133/2001/QD-TTg dated 10 September 2001 of the Prime Minister also gives the green light for agro-processing firms to obtain loans.
However, interviewed companies stated that it is difficult to get funding from DAF.
Funding is determined by provincial People's Committees and shared by different agro-processing sectors, dominated by state-controlled enterprises, regardless of the registration.
Overall, DAF is made available to less than 15% of private sector companies in Vietnam, although this accounts for most exports and job growth.
Meat processing companies stated that their preference is other sources of funding, usually "grey market" financing, although commercial banks are becoming more and more active.
The Government of Vietnam has also created incentives to encourage investment and development in agro-processing sector.
Resolution No. 6-NQ/TW dated 10 November 1998, the Government listed livestock breeding as an official production sector in the nation's economy.
This decision will have far-reaching effects as the formal recognition of the sector shall provide the foundation for cross ministerial policy platforms and program activities.
Most recently, the Ministry of Finance's Decision 65/2001/QD-BTC, dated 29 June 2001, provides an incentive bonus for the export of pork at VND 900 (Cdn$ equivalent?) per $1.00 worth of export.
There are a number of other legal documents giving incentives to livestock breeding and processing.
Meat processing equipment, according to the Ministry of Finance, is subject to a 3% to 5%. import tax.
Tax on equipment for special projects can be waived.
Nevertheless, all equipment is subject to a 5% to a 10% VAT (GST), although this needs to be confirmed on a case by case basis.
Depending on the region, there may be other tax incentives that could apply to meat processors, such as the remote area incentives or other incentives.
As the deadline for implementation of tariff reductions as part of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) draws closer, Vietnam will be seriously challenged to maintain and develop its domestic production for processed meats.
The current tax on imported processed meat products ranges from 20% to 30%, of which pork products have the highest tax.
After the AFTA treaty is in force in 2006, the tax for processed meat will only be 5%.
The potential impact of the BTA and WTO treaties are less easy to predict, although many countries will reserve pre-accession negotiations for commodities such as pork and beef.
The local companies interviewed were well aware of the changing environment, although there is no national association for the sector.
In-country representation has proven to be the most effective way to sell equipment in Vietnam.
Vietnamese consumers like "tangible" evidence of manufacturers' commitment to the market, and want to be able to contact them quickly and easily in the event that there are technical issues (after-sales service and training are increasingly important sales factors).
In-country representatives can better understand business customs and regulations, to structure equipment sale arrangement more efficiently and cost-effectively.
They are also more able to assist customers in lobbying for soft loan, customs procedures, delivery tracking, etc.
Vietnam is a developing economy, and still qualifies for concessionary loans and grants from a number of bilateral and multilateral sources, many of which are used by manufacturers of the same country of origin.
Marketing and Promotion The most effective way to promote equipment is to participate in trade fairs, wherever possible, and to organize technical seminars with the participation of end-user companies, related ministries, and provincial authorities.
Follow up work after seminars should include meetings with the company decision-makers.
Ministry people are important in cases where firms are state owned.
Marketing materials need to be tailored to the local style and presented in the Vietnamese language.
Technical visits to equipment manufacturing sites or to-equipped-facilities are useful in providing a more direct marketing approach.
Equipment Sales Most equipment sales are done on a one to one basis between a dealership or representative and the individual firm's executives.
Relationship building is of the utmost importance.
Visited executives have stated that they have received sales people in the past but follow up contact has generally been poor and sporadic.
The request for catalogues during the research process speaks of the curiosity and the demand.
Site visits to Canada are very important and timely business visa processing is critical.
Several firm executives have stated that the difficulty in obtaining Canadian visas was taken as a sign that Canada (in general) is not interested in doing business.
This is a perception that needs to change, and change quickly, and recent changes to visa issuance through the Consulate-General of Canada in HCMC (from January 2003) will hopefully address some of the concerns (most importantly, quick turnaround).
Canadian companies wishing to facilitate Vietnamese visits to Canada should advise the commercial sections of the Embassy or Consulate-General as soon as they learn about prospective visits.
Purchases of large equipment in Vietnam, particularly through state-owned companies, are often arranged through tenders.
It is critical to get to know and work with customers before the tender documents are made and released to the public.
This is to ensure that the manufacturer's equipment specifications match the tender document specifications.
This takes patience and time.
Financial leasing is a potential source of funding that may have some potential in Vietnam, particularly as this sector becomes better known and as the sector becomes further liberalized as part of the US/Vietnam BTA.
Payment and Contracts Payment for imported equipment is generally done through letters of credit.
This is now a standard method in Vietnam.
Any concerns regarding Vietnamese issuing institutions can be addressed to the Canadian missions in Vietnam.
All contract details should be carefully analyzed, especially concerning warranties and replacement parts, payment systems and tax liabilities.
Relying on recourse to the law is not a suggested strategy as the Vietnamese judicial system is poorly developed and enforcement, particularly against state-owned companies, difficult.
Offshore arbitration is a common business practice between foreign and domestic parties who enter into serious business relationships; again, Vietnamese courts require enforcement.
The services of Export Development Canada and of the Canadian Commercial Corporation are available for Vietnam.
For further details, contact the Canadian missions in Vietnam.
The Competition For Slaughter Line And Meat Processing Equipment As the meat processing sector is in an emerging market period, there has yet to be the substantial development of competitive equipment markets having defined company market shares.
Strong demand is only now emerging and companies with a presence in Vietnam, either representative offices or dealership networks, will take the near future market share.
The Danish Embassy has focused effort on broadening Danish firm's access to the animal husbandry and meat processing markets.
This includes a recent market analysis of the Pig Meat Sector and efforts by their trade division to promote bilateral business relations include the mixed credit program (subsidized credit).
Two third-level meat processors (under 5000 tonnes per year) in northern Vietnam have recently completed plant upgrades with German equipment.
VISSAN executives have already spoken with Dutch, German, Italian and Spanish manufacturers regarding their 40 million dollar investment plans.
The competitive equipment market is divided into two categories: representative offices and agencies with local firms.
Representative offices most often deal with a broad range of food processing equipment and are focused on larger turnkey factories or more expensive sub-process equipment.
Equipment bearing the brand names of Seiderman, Cossini, and Mouler are currently sold in-country.
It is more difficult to identify and verify information on Vietnamese trading firms.
According to the people interviewed in this research, these trading firms appear to be opportunistic, rarely having exclusive dealership arrangements, and reluctant to divulge which equipment they are representing and selling for fear of having in-country competition.
This dealership relationship is a point to consider for market entry strategy for Canadian companies.
The Canadian missions in Vietnam can provide advice on individual companies, particularly if referred to by third parties.
A number of countries, such as Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom are increasingly focusing on commercial missions aimed at the growing food preparation and packaging sector.
The Canadian missions in Vietnam are interested in a similar technical seminar and mission planned for 2003.
Interested parties should contact the missions (contacts below).

Tuy Hoa Producing Agricultural And Fishery
1 Royal Danish Embassy - Danish Economic and Commercial Office (12/2001) The pig meat sector of Vietnam:
31; "When compared to the rest of the world, meat prices in Vietnam are still relatively high and not competitive, e.g., exported pork is quoted at US$ 750 per ton in Red River Delta and USD $900-1000 in the south, while U.S. companies sell leaner export products for US$600-700, and the Chinese for US$650 per ton." 3 Equipment was primarily imported from northern European countries.
4 These figures were provided by industry executives as well as analysis of published reports and marketing materials from 1999 to the present day.
It is standard practice for Vietnamese firms to under-report growth and expansion, and the tax and regulatory system has yet to enforce accounting standards.
5 Given the limited pool of investment capital and significant competition between processing firms whether provincial (state) food companies, private, joint venture or foreign firms, accessing subsidized (whether loan guarantees or low interest) state investment capital will be more difficult to justify as the downstream markets are competitive.
The biggest of these firms may process upwards of 200 90kg hogs per day at best.
Market Information Southeast Asia Bio-Industry - Sector Profile - Vietnam July 2003 The Canadian Embassy in Vietnam 31 Hung Vuong St. Hanoi, Vietnam Tel.: (011-84-4) 823-5500 Fax: (011-84-4) 823-5333 E-mail: hanoi-td@dfait-maeci.gc.ca Internet: www.infoexport.gc.ca/vn
Market Overview Biotechnology in Vietnam is a high priority for the government.
Research activities in government-own institutes are focused on molecular biology and genetic engineering; microbial biotechnology for the production of bioactive compounds, biofertilizers; environmental protection and soil remediation; enzyme biotechnology; plant biotechnology for in-vitro conservation; the propagation of superior germplasm (plant tissue culture for mass propagation of planting material for horticulture, fruit and forestry industries and for developing high yield plants); and animal biotechnology methods.
However, these research activities are heavily dependent on government funding or overseas development assistance (ODA) support.
To date, there has been little domestic or foreign investment in the sector.
The government has been developing standards for the industry, with a focus on developing regulations to control imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and genetically modified foods (GMF) and to improve food safety.
Opportunities Current priorities for biotechnology development in Vietnam focus on the agricultural and forestry sector.
A few laboratories have been built to conduct research on plant tissue technology for developing high yield crops and the propagation of plants for afforestation.
Vietnam imports modest amounts of laboratory and clinical equipment each year to support its research activities.
Canadian equipment has been reasonably successful.
Several projects are under way involving Canadian companies looking to improve the genetic stock of livestock in Vietnam, but these may be impacted by the BSE outbreak, despite a recent signature of Animal Health Protocol between the two countries for various animal products (including a certificate for exporting swine).
Market Access Considerations Although government interest is high, there is limited funding available to address the challenges that Vietnam faces in developing its agri-food sector.
Government revenues spent on this sector are less than $3.14 million(1) per annum, with the balance funded by ODA or the private sector.
Specifically, there are concerns regarding Vietnam's poor record in intellectual property protection, as well as shortages of qualified technical staff.
This limits the demand for biotechnology in the short term.
With limited expertise on the local market, interested exporters should look at partnering with a regional company that is likely to have better connections within Vietnam, and more interest in investment.
Key Participants Since rice is the dominant commodity in Vietnam's agricultural sector, holding position number 2 in exporting rice worldwide, it has received the most attention from the biotech industry.
Rice seed products from China and Taiwan dominate, and Korea and Japan have also been active.
Suppliers of laboratory equipment for biotech research are mainly from the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan.

Market Information Southeast Asia The Powdered Segment of the Fruit Juice Industry* February 2005
Ronald Mark G. Omaña Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business University of Asia and the Pacific Juices enjoy wide exposure especially in supermarkets and groceries.
There are five types of juices sold in the market, namely: fruit juice; fruit juice from concentrate; fruit nectar; concentrated fruit juice; and dehydrated or powdered fruit juice.
The Food Safety Authority of Ireland describes the juice types as follows:
Table 1.
Juice Types and Description Fruit juice
• The extracted juice of fruit, which has not been concentrated.
Has a shelf life of "days"
• May not contain any artificial flavors, colors or additives other than carbon dioxide and acidifying agents Fruit juice from concentrate
• Juice which has been concentrated and returned to its original state by the addition of water Fruit nectar
• Obtained by adding water and sugar and/or honey to fruit juice, fruit juice from concentrate, concentrated fruit juice, dehydrated/powdered fruit juice, fruit puree or a mixture of these products Concentrated fruit juice
• Product obtained from fruit juice of one or more kinds by the physical removal of a specific proportion of the water content.
• It is necessary to dilute this product with water before consumption Dehydrated / Powdered fruit juice
• Product obtained from fruit juice of one or more kinds by the physical removal of virtually all the water content.
Food Safety Authority of Ireland (www.fsai.ie) Household spending on fruit juices and non-carbonated drinks (powdered, concentrated, and ready-to-drink) was estimated at P7.2 billion in 2000 from P5.1 billion in 1997 (National Statistics Office (NSO)- Family Income and Expenditure Survey).
In addition, there are several variants available in the market.
The Players The industry is dominated by two major players, namely, San Miguel Corporation subsidiary Philippine Beverage Partners Inc.
(PhilBev) and multinational firm Kraft Foods (Philippines) Inc.
Other players include large companies in the food and beverage industries such as Nestle Phils.
Inc., RFM Corporation, and Universal Robina Corporation.
Procter and Gamble Philippines, Inc. also entered the market in 1999 but stopped in just a few years' time.
Relatively new players in the market include Zest-O Corporation, Liwayway Marketing Corporation, and Ajinomoto Philippines Corporation.
Philippine Beverage Partners Inc. is a subsidiary of Southeast Asia's largest food and beverage company San Miguel Corporation (SMC).
It owns the popular Eight o' Clock brand as well as the Ponkana and Ice Cold Mix brands.
PhilBev also manages other non-carbonated products of San Miguel such Fun Chum and Magnolia ready-to-drink fruit drinks and Wilkin's distilled water and Viva!
PhilBev's juice brands were originally owned by Sugarland International Products Inc. but were acquired by parent firm SMC together with another SMC subsidiary La Tondeña Distillers Inc.
(now Ginebra San Miguel Inc.) in May 2000 for P2.9 billion.
PhilBev has eight flavors for its Eight o' Clock brand (orange, pineapple, dalandan, pomelo, calamansi, lemonade, orange-mango, and orange-pineapple) while its Ice Cold Mix comes in pomelo and pineapple flavors.
Kraft Foods (Philippines) Inc. owns and produces powdered juices using the Tang, Tang Ponkan-C, and Kool-Aid brands.
Its powdered juices are imported from Thailand except for those in one-liter packs which are toll-manufactured locally.
Aside from the tangerine orange flavor (Tang Ponkan-C), Tang comes in seven other flavors, namely, orange, pineapple, grape, guyabano, pomelo, lemon, and mango.
RFM Corporation is the Philippine licensee of Sunkist Growers Inc. to manufacture powdered and ready-to-drink juices using the Sunkist brand.
Sunkist powdered juices are available in eight flavors (orange, pineapple, dalandan, pomelo, lemonade, four seasons, watermelon, and green mango).
RFM recently launched its Sunkist singles in 9-gram packs.
One of the newer players in the powdered juice segment, Ajinomoto Philippines Corporation launched its powdered juices in September 2003 using the Fres-C brand initially in orange, pomelo, and pineapple flavors.
In February 2005, the company added three new flavors - calamansi, guava, and lychee.
Liwayway Marketing Corporation (LMC), known as the manufacturer of Oishi snack food products, entered the powdered juice segment in early 2003 using the Sundays brand.
Sold initially in one-liter packs and in three variants (orange, pineapple and lemonade), Sundays has recently introduced its powdered drinks in 250-gram and 500-gram packs.
The company also launched two additional flavors, namely, dalanghita and mango.
LMC claims it is the first to introduce mango flavored powdered juice in the market, ahead of industry leaders PhilBev and Kraft Foods.
Universal Robina Corporation (URC) launched its powdered juice Refresh in mid-2000 in two flavors - orange and dalandan in 250-gram and 400-gram packs.
In early 2004, however, the company ceased manufacturing the powdered drink to re-think its strategy for the product.
Despite of this, the Refresh brand remains visible as it is being used by URC for its ready-to-drink juice and packaged water.
Zest-O Corporation is the leader in the ready-to-drink juices in doy-packs (flexible foil pouch).
It has powdered juices using the Sunglo brand.
At present, Sunglo is available in three flavors (orange, strawberry, and lemon).
The product used to have the pineapple flavor until early this year when it ceased producing the said variant.
All flavors come in 250-gram, 500-gram, and 750-gram packs.
Another multinational company, Procter & Gamble Philippines Inc. entered the powdered juice segment in 1999 thru its Nutri Delight brand.
The product was positioned as a fortified powdered orange drink with Iron, Vitamin A, and Iodine.
A few years later, however, the company stopped producing Nutri Delight.
The Market The market for powdered juices is estimated to be worth at least P8 billion in 2004.
PhilBev and Kraft are the market leaders.

Key Industry Informant In terms of flavor, industry players say the largest-selling powdered juice flavor remains to be orange while other flavors like pineapple are also performing well.
Trade Powdered juices are classified by the NSO under the Philippine Standard Commodity Classification Code 0989905 as preparations for the manufacture of lemonades or other beverages consisting, for example, of flavored or colored syrup, syrup-flavored with fruit juices.
Trade data revealed that imports outpaced exports for an entire five-year period beginning 2000.
Imports and Exports of Powdered Juice, 2000-2004
IMPORTS EXPORTS Year Volume Value Volume Value
NSO Imports.
From nearly 29,500 tons (US$ (CIF) 49.2 million), imports increased by 53% to about 45,200 tons (US$64.6 million) in 2001.
Growth was fuelled by increased shipments from country-suppliers like the United States of America (USA), Brazil, Ireland, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Thailand, Malaysia, and Taiwan.
The following year, imports contracted by nearly 15% to 43,800 tons (US$70 million), due to the huge drop in purchases from Canada, Brazil, Ireland, United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea.
Only Canada, Brazil, France, New Zealand, India, and Taiwan managed to increase their shipments into the country.
NSO Exports.
The decline was caused by reduced purchases by major buyers like Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
By 2003, shipments further dropped by 59% to 51 tons (US$ 250,000) due to lower purchases of Taiwan and Hong Kong and non-purchase of South Korea, despite improved exports to Thailand and new shipments to Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar, Ireland, and Puerto Rico.
In 2004, exports grew by more than five times to 278 tons (US$1.1 million), boosted by large purchases by Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, and South Africa.

Marketing Trends The industry is characterized by stiff competition, particularly in the market for economy packs or powdered drinks in sachets.
Almost all manufacturers have small-serve one liter or litro packs (45 grams), which are sold at very affordable prices of less than P10.
Table 3 shows the retail prices of selected powdered juice brands for various pack sizes.
For the 500-gram pack, Eight o' Clock is more expensive by P0.25 compared to the P38.25 retail price of Tang.
For the 750-gram pack, Sunglo is more affordable at P49.75 compared to P62.50 for Tang.
Eight o' Clock and the other brands do not have this pack size.
Finally, for the 1-kilogram pack, Eight o' Clock is sold cheaper by P3.25 at P76.50 compared to Tang's P79.75. Table 3.

Major supermarket in Mandaluyong City, April 2005 Players also promote their products as healthy and good for the body, emphasizing on the vitamin and mineral contents of their products.
A look at the labels of three popular brands (Eight o' Clock, Tang, and Sunkist) revealed the following nutrition facts:
Vitamin and Mineral Content of Selected Powdered Juice Drinks Vitamin / Mineral Eight o' Clock Tang Sunkist Vitamins
Vitamin C Vitamin A
Vitamin B2
Folic Acid

Beta-Carotene Minerals

Product labels Another "healthy" selling proposition employed for powdered juice drink is promoting it as low calorie.
This is currently being used by PhilBev for its Eight o' Clock and Ponkana products, as well as Ajinomoto's Fres-C.
Lastly, product extension or the introduction of new flavors has been used as a tool to attract consumers.
While the leading brands have the most number of variants, the new players are utilizing this approach to gain market share.
Ajinomoto, for instance, recently introduced flavors never before seen in the market like lychee and guava, while Zest-O Corporation's Sunglo has a strawberry flavor.
At the same time, Eight o' Clock has combined-flavored drinks like orange-mango, and orange-pineapple.
Prospects Research firm AC Nielsen reported that the market for powdered juice drinks is still growing although at a slower rate compared to ready-to-drink juices.
According to players, they expect the segment to post continued growth in the next three to five years.
Performance will be driven mainly by strong demand for economy packs while those in bigger packs will continue to post steady growth rates.
The entry of new players, despite the pull-out of URC, indicates a growing market.
Existing players view this as a challenge since more would mean more product options for the consumer.
Industry sources say innovation would remain vital for success.
Most importantly, the trend towards healthier, better-for-you products is still expected to fuel growth as powdered juice presents itself as a "better" beverage than substitutes like ice tea and carbonated drinks.
Now, there is a pending bill in Congress which seeks to prohibit the use of aspartame, a sweetener used in powdered juices.
Overall though, industry players project a bright future for their business.
In the short- term, sales are expected to move-up as consumers gulp more of powdered juice drinks as the summer heat intensifies.

Market Information Southeast Asia Drink all you can:
A Glimpse of the Imported Fruit Juice Market* February 2005
Abner T. Montecalvo Kay S. Olivas Ma. Lourdes P. Vivo Graduate Students Food Systems Management (FSM) Program University of Asia and the Pacific Consumption of fruit juices and non-carbonated drinks in the Philippines has increased considerably from P3 billion (at current prices) in 1993 to about P7.2 billion in 2000, a hefty increase of 137% (National Statistics Office - Family Income and Expenditure Survey, 2000).
Fruit juice supply in the country comes mainly from local production.
Imports are still rather small although they have been posting consistent growth over the years.
How fruit juices are made Fruit juices, along with vegetable juices, are "generally obtained by pressing fresh, healthy and ripe fruit vegetable."
Juices are "obtained by means of mechanical "extractors" operating on the same principle as the household lemon squeezer, or by pressing, which may or may not be preceded either by crushing or grinding (for apples) in particular or by treatment with cold water or with steam (in the case of tomatoes, blackcurrants and certain vegetables such as carrots and celery)."
Trends in imported fruit juices Fruit juices are generally imported in the form of either fruit juice extracts for use as raw material, or finished juice drinks.
In the Philippines, official customs data classify the imported products according to the type of fruit (e.g. orange), form (concentrate) and state (frozen or not frozen).
Fruit juices are also classified according to the degree of sweetness (Brix content).
From 2000-2004, the country imported over 9,500 tons of juices yearly worth more than US$7.5 million annually (Table 1).
The leading suppliers were the United States of America (USA), Australia and Israel.
The leading juice imports during the same period were orange juice, other than concentrates, not frozen and juice of any single fruit/vegetable, other than concentrates.
The former accounted for close to a fifth of the total value of juice imports while the latter, for 12%.
The main country sources were the USA and Australia.
Volume and value of imported juices, 2000-2004
National Statistics Office Meanwhile, about 70% of the total value of juice imports is in the form of juices, other than concentrates, or finished juice drinks.
The rest is accounted for by juice concentrates, the share of which has been increasing in the past five years.
Imports are mostly those of fruits which are not locally grown such as apples, oranges, grapes, and grapefruit.
By fruit type, imports are dominated by orange juices (both concentrates and other than concentrates, frozen and not frozen).
The leading suppliers were also Australia, the USA and Israel.
Key players Importers of fruit juices are composed of both fruit juice or food processors and importer-distributors.
As of 2003, there were 126 registered importers of fruit juices, according to the Bureau of Import Statistics.
The top ten importers in 2003 accounted for more than half of the total value of fruit juice imports.
The juices are imported from countries like Australia, Spain, South Africa, USA, Cyprus/Nicosia and Austria.
The available brands in the market include:

Regulations and requirements in the importation of fruit juices Tariffs and taxes.
Import duties are levied by the Bureau of Customs at the time of import and are required to be paid to the government before the incoming shipment is allowed entry into the country.
Another tax paid on imported juices is the value added tax (VAT).
A 10% VAT is charged on total landed cost, a value that includes the CIF cost, import duties, brokerage fees, wharfage and other charges.
Quality standards.
Imported foods, beverages and agricultural food products are required to comply with certain regulations concerning food safety.
The importation of packaged foods such as juices is covered by the Food and Drug Act, which ensures that Filipino consumers are provided with safe and good quality food.
The Act establishes standards and quality measures for food and sets up the enforcement framework necessary to ensure a safe supply of food in the country.
It covers both locally manufactured and imported products.
While they pose competition to local juices as well as other non-alcoholic beverages such fruit-flavored soda, they provide the consumers a wide array of choices - especially, juices from fruits that are not locally or commonly grown in the Philippines.
It should be noted though that imported juices are priced higher than their local counterpart.
Prices are affected mainly by the fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rate.
The market consists of those belonging to income brackets A, B and upper C, given that most imported juices command higher prices.
As people become more health conscious, they learn to appreciate the benefits that they can derive from natural fruit juices.
As defined in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes, World Customs Organization 2.
There are two major reasons why fruit juices are made into concentrates within the country of origin: (1) environmental and ecological and, (2) commercial and costs.
About 5/6 of freshly picked pressed fruit juice consist of water; the rest is juice.
It is this 1/6 which serves as the basis for the fruit juice concentrates prior to transportation it does not make sense to transport to ship 5/6 of the end product or water or transport in trucks across half the world since this will be a waste of energy.
Apart from that, it would result in prices for the finished product being driven up to acceptable levels (from www.pfanner.com).
Market Information Southeast Asia Pasta!
(A Look into the Philippine Market for Imported and Local Pasta) *
Ronald G. Omaña Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific
Pasta is the generic Italian term for many noodle-like doughs that are made in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.
According to the National Pasta Association of the United States, more than 600 pasta shapes are produced around the world whose names come from their shape.
Although its true beginnings are somewhat unclear, Italy is recognized as the home of pasta in modern times.
This is attributed to the Italian traveler Marco Polo who is said to have brought pasta to Italy from China 700 years ago.
Pasta then reached the United Kingdom through aristocrats touring Europe.
By the nineteenth century, immigrants brought with them their pasta-eating custom.
The British are believed to have introduced pasta into the United States.
They taught the practice of cooking noodles at least half an hour and mixing them with cream sauce and cheese.
TYPES OF PASTA Pastas are classified into two types – dried and fresh.
Leading food manufacturer Hormel Foods describes the two pasta types as follows:
Dried Pasta (Pasta Secca) Dried pasta is readily available in many sizes and shapes.
It is factory made and fully dried before it is packaged.
It rarely contains eggs so it can be stored indefinitely without refrigerating or freezing.
Its firmness also allows it to be stored easily without damage.
Fresh Pasta (Pasta Fresca) Fresh pasta is available in a variety of sizes and shapes but not to the extent of dried pasta.
It also comes in a greater variety of flavors.
Fresh pasta most often contains eggs and has high water content, making refrigeration or freezing necessary to keep it from spoiling.
GLOBAL PRODUCTION In 2003, Italy's pasta producer association, the Unione Industriali Pastai Italiani has estimated world pasta production at 9.3 million tons.
The three leading producers are the European Union (EU) which accounted for 43% of total production, followed by Central and South America (19%), North America (16%), and other European countries (12%).
Countries in North Africa, Asia, and Oceania regions contributed 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively.
THE PLAYERS The Philippines pasta market is composed of big firms which are also players in other agri-food industries.
These include Unilever Bestfoods (formerly California Manufacturing Co.
(DMPI), RFM Corporation, Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory Inc., Universal Robina Corporation (URC) and General Milling Corporation (GMC).
Major retailers Supervalue Inc.
(SM Supermarkets) and Robinson's Supermarket Inc. also have pasta for their private labels SM Bonus and Supersavers, respectively.
Food and beverage conglomerate Nestle Phils.
Inc. is said to have its own pasta products under the Maggi brand which is sold only to the foodservice industry.
Some of the local players have developed separate brands to capture both the AB and CD markets.
For instance, Unilever Bestfoods has Knorr Royal for the high-end market and Bestfoods for the low-end market.
Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory, meanwhile, has Ideal (high-end), and Sunshine (low-end).
General Milling Corporation also adopted this strategy with its Homepride (high-end) and Magnifico (low-end) brands. Other companies like DMPI, RFM, and URC maintain only one brand each.

MARKET Industry sources estimate the overall market for pasta at P2.5 billion in 2003, up from about P1.5 billion in 2000.
A key player, however, indicated that the value could be much higher.
Household spending on pasta, which is lumped together with bihon, miki, misua, sotanghon, etc., reached P3.7 billion in 2000, up by 12% from P3.3 billion in 1997.
The amount accounted for about 2% of the entire household spending for cereals and cereal preparations for both years.
Research firm ACNielsen classified pasta under the slightly increasing food category - with growth of 5% to 9% per year.
Pasta grew by 8% as of April 2005, an improvement from its stable rating (growth rate of -4% to 4%) in October 2003.
Despite the numerous kinds of pasta which could be offered in the market, the pasta products of the major local players are more often limited to spaghetti and macaroni (elbow and/or salad types).
By contrast, the other imported brands have more diverse offerings such as lasagna, linguine, fettucine, bowtie, spirals, penne and small shells, etc.
In terms of overall market shares by brand in 2003, Unilever Bestfoods' Knorr Royal led with share of 25%, followed by RFM Corporation's White King Fiesta (17%) and DMPI's Del Monte (12%).
Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory's Ideal brand captured 8% of the market while URC's El Real and GMC's Magnifico had 6% each of the market.
Other brands which include the imported labels shared in the remaining 17% of the market.

Industry Estimates
In terms of market channel, sources say Knorr Royal, Del Monte and Ideal are the three leading brands in supermarkets and groceries.
In the wet market, where pasta is placed in big plastic basins and sold on a per-scoop basis, Ideal is the undisputed leader followed by White King Fiesta.
Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory Inc. claims leadership in the foodservice channel as it caters to many of the major players in the fast food industry.
By target market, Knorr Royal is the leader in the high-end market for spaghetti.
Del Monte is next and then, Ideal.
For the low-end market, White King Fiesta is on top, followed by Sunshine.
For the macaroni market, Ideal is the leading brand in the high-end category, followed by Knorr Royal.
For the low-end market, White King Fiesta captures the lead, followed by Sunshine.
Interestingly, Ideal and Sunshine maker Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory Inc. also produces the SM Bonus spaghetti and macaroni for the SM supermarket chain.
For the imported brands, the main market channels are the hotels and restaurants and the major supermarkets.
Sources say the market for pasta is still influenced heavily by "occasions" as reflected by the product's lean and peak periods.
Lean months are January, February, June, and July while the peak months include April and May where fiestas are usually held, and November and December, the holiday season.
TRADE Pasta trade has been in favor of imports throughout the five-year period beginning 2000.
The National Statistics Office (NSO) classifies pasta under five Philippine Standard Commodity Classification Codes: 0483009 - other uncooked pasta, not stuffed, containing eggs; 0483011 – macaroni, spaghetti and lasagna, uncooked, not stuffed, containing eggs; 0483019 – other uncooked pasta, not stuffed, not containing eggs; 0989101/0989105 – pasta (e.g. macaroni, spaghetti, reviolli, lasagna, vermicelli, cannelloni, tortellino, and the like); and 0989109 – other pasta.
By 2002, shipments to the country increased further by 37% to 16,000 tons (US$8.7 million).
In 2003, however, a sharp decline of 50% was registered as purchases reached only 8,000 tons; value dropped by nearly the same rate to US$4.6 million.
The contraction was brought about by the decrease in imports in all categories.
By 2004, import volumes rose by a huge 82% to nearly 15,000 tons equivalent to US$8.0 million.
Overall, imports grew by an average rate of 31% per year while value expanded by 21% per annum from 2000-2004.
NSO
Interestingly, leading player Unilever Bestfoods buys its spaghetti from this country.
Australia was followed by Italy (4%), Taiwan (3%), and South Korea (2%).
Other countries shared in the remaining 9% of total value of imports.
Pasta exports ballooned from only a little over 500 tons (US$1.5 million) in 2000 to 1,600 tons (US$4.0 million) in 2001.
In 2004, volumes improved by 13% to 2,500 tons (US$6.9 million).
From 2000-2004, exports grew by more than 200% annually on volume and by 300% yearly on value.
This was because of the very low base in 1999 of only 57 tons amounting to US$91,000 as compared to 979 tons worth US$1.6 million in 2000.

PROSPECTS Players see the pasta market to maintain its growth of 8% to 10% in the next three to five years.
Performance will still be driven by the numerous fiestas and celebrations all over the country.
The growth in population and incomes are also seen to help the business keep its uphill climb.
The edge of instant noodles over pasta is its ease of preparation (3-5 minutes) compared to pasta which normally requires 10 to 15 minutes.
To address this concern, players say the consumers must be taught innovative ways of using pasta aside from the usual spaghetti or baked macaroni.
In recent years, the marketing strategies used to boost sales included bundling pasta with a complementing product – sauces.
RFM Corporation, meanwhile, utilized a celebrity to endorse its product and placed her picture on the packaging.
Another strategy, employed by Unilever Bestfoods, is the emphasis on the vitamin and mineral content of pasta to attract health-conscious consumers.
Another growth factor for the industry is the expanding fast food industry where spaghetti remains as a favorite menu item.
Importers, meanwhile, expect slower expansion rate for imported pasta as it competes with local pasta in terms of quality but sold at more affordable prices.
As more and more consumers enjoy eating pasta, the industry would definitely enjoy a more than an ‘al dente' pasta business.

The Philippine chicken industry is a significant contributor to the  country's agriculture sector.
It is third after palay and hog in terms of value of output.
Chicken production in 2004 was about 1.2M tons live weight, of which around 65% was broiler.
But where are we as compared with other countries?
The top world producers are the United States of America (USA), with a share of 27%; China, 17%; Brazil, 15%; and European Union, 13%.
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  Philippines - Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI)
Among the Asian countries, China, Japan and Thailand have consistently been the top producers.
However, China and Thailand are not exporters while Japan is a net importer.
The Philippines is way behind producing an average of only 570,000 tons per year.
Consumption World consumption of chicken meat in 2004 reached 53.3M tons.
The USA is the world's largest consumer both in aggregate and per capita terms.
It is among the lowest when compared to Asian countries like Japan (14.5 kg per capita) and Thailand (12.7 kg) but higher than Indonesia (3.1 kg) and India (1.5 kg).
It is even far lower compared to developed countries like the USA and Canada with 43.2 kg and 29.2 kg, respectively.
Brazil, Australia and New Zealand also have high consumption of more than 30 kilograms per capita.
Poultry International, May 2005
Exports World poultry exports in 2004 were almost stagnant compared to 2003, as major importing countries banned the entry of poultry products because of the outbreak of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).
The outbreak led major producers in Asia such as Thailand and China to stop exporting chilled and frozen chicken.
On the other hand, some countries still managed to sustain positive growth despite the impact of HPAI.

Japan, for instance, which sourced bulk of its processed chicken requirement from Thailand, had reduced tremendously its imports from this country and looked for alternative sources.
Because of the Philippines' proximity to Japan and because it was HPAI-free during the major outbreak, it paved the way for Philippine chicken to enter the Japanese market.
The first shipment to Japan was in March 2004 by San Miguel Purefoods.
For 2004, exports of chicken meat and meat cuts reached 1,560 tons (industry data).
Bulk of exports was in the form of frozen boneless leg and frozen wing stick.
Recently, however, there have been reports that a low-risk bird flu strain has reached the Philippines.
Imports Import demand for broiler meat has declined by 10% in 2004.
The big importers like Japan and China have reduced the entry of poultry products into their territories by as much as 16% and 60%, respectively, due to the HPAI.

Russia is the number one importer and the biggest market for the United States.
It is followed by Japan which has high demand for boneless chicken meat, and the European Union (EU).
The EU imposes the strictest environmental and animal welfare laws.
Exporting to EU entails the highest cost.
The Philippines imposes quantitative restrictions on poultry imports.
The country imports chicken meat and meat cuts in order to augment local supply.
Imports reached a high of 23 million kg in 2004, up by 44% from 2003.
In 2004, chicken leg quarters accounted 75.5% of the total meat imports while deboned chicken and chicken cuts cornered 23.7%.
The rest of the imports were in the form of whole chicken and chicken fats, which contributed a measly share.
Prices and Cost Movements in live broiler prices in key countries reflect developments in world broiler trade.
Among the key countries, China and Brazil experienced decreasing prices of live broilers.
Brazil registered the lowest prices ranging from P26-P27/kg, while Thailand recorded lower prices relative to China and the Philippines.
The Philippines, although not a major world producer as compared to Thailand and China, had higher broiler prices of P39-P43/kg.
Live broiler prices are reflective of the cost of production.
A comparison of cost performance across key broiler countries in Asia showed that Brazil was the lowest cost producer as it had the lowest cost of corn and soybean meal.
China, in contrast, had the lowest labor cost.
The Philippines posted the highest input cost, particularly, for corn and day-old chicks (DOC).

Yanson (2005) The Plus Factors
The Philippine broiler industry possesses a competitive edge.
First, Filipino buyers still prefer warm meat over frozen meat.
Because of this, the entry of frozen chicken remains limited as household consumers still prefer to buy fresh, chilled chicken over frozen ones.
Second, the Philippines is fortunate not to be included in the HPAI affected areas during the major outbreak in 2003.
While there have been reports that a low-risk flu strain found in ducks has already entered the country, the Philippines was able to confine it in a small isolated farm.
The Philippines was somehow given time for HPAI preparedness through prevention programs crafted by industry players and government.
Another plus factor is the expected growth in chicken consumption due to its price advantage versus other meats, higher per capita income and increase in population.
Can we compete?
The Philippines, even with its advantage of being HPAI-free, can barely export chicken due to uncompetitive cost.
The country's cost of production is way above other producing countries due to high cost of corn and DOC.
Corn is a major input to broiler feeds, accounting for about 70% of cost.
The Philippines can export provided it has access to low cost of inputs.
A low tariff corn from Thailand, for example, could help lower the total cost of production.
Another possibility is to concentrate on higher value-added chicken addressing the demand for cooked products in other countries such as Japan.
Brazil will remain as the biggest exporter of chicken to the world, followed by the US.
The US is strong in bone-in legs export due to consumers preference for white meat.
The EU, which has the most stringent environmental and animal welfare laws, will continue to be a major exporter.
Thailand is slowly shifting to cooked products form instead of frozen chicken.
This is where the Philippines can also come in with cost considerations.
The Philippine broiler industry will continue to be an import-dependent industry primarily because of dependency on the importation of DOC Grand Parent Stocks.

CAN-SEA Agri-Food Update June-September 2006
RECENT AGRI-FOOD ACTIVITIES A Halal Seminar was held in Brunei on August 8-9, in conjunction with International Halal Products Expo 2006.
Three Canadian speakers were invited – Mr Falal Alizzi (ZABIHA Halal), Dr Mohammed Ashraf (Islamic Society of North America) and Mr Pervez Nasim (Canadian Islamic Trust Foundation).
In mid August, Post in Brunei participated in the Domestic Science Exhibition organised in conjunction with the Sultan's birthday.
At this event, the spouses of the diplomatic corps organised a booth and invited participation from various foreign missions.
Post took the opportunity to showcase Canadian Wild Rice and Maple Syrup.
There was lots of public interest, including that of Queen and Princesses, in the wild rice.
As a follow-up, Post is seeking Canadian suppliers to work the Brunei market.
On September 18, Singapore organised the CPI Pork Seminar and the event was well attended by key members of the Meat Traders Association (MTA), who saw Canadian pork as growing in popularity and positioned as a high-end pork product in the market.
Senior representatives from the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) also graced the occasion, lending support to the event.
AVA has been supporting the efforts of Canadian companies to increase their pork exports, as it is in Singapore’s interest to diversify its supply sources.
Martin Lavoie, CPI’s Assistant Executive Director and member Jeffrey Clarke codelivered a presentation highlighting the opportunities for Singapore to adopt Canadian pork products.
Thereafter, a networking luncheon featuring Canadian pork was served to an appreciative audience.
The CPI seminar also addressed the interest of some Singapore pork importers to be part of a pork mission of MTA members and AVA.
Post plans to organise a buyers’ trip for them to Canada during SIAL Montréal in 2007.
Canada continues to press hard and vigorously with the Indonesian government to obtain access for Canadian beef and beef products.
On June 20, following the announcement of Thailand opening borders to Canadian beef issued by Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, the Embassy had the Press Release translated into Thai and sent it to general and business media to raise awareness that the ban on Canadian beef has been lifted.
The Embassy hired people who produce a monthly magazine called " Thailand Restaurant News" to create a onepage leaflet that includes information about the lifting of the ban on Canadian beef in Thailand.
On July 25-26, Canada Pork International (CPI) Executive Director Jacques Pomerleau, facilitated by Thailand agri-food Trade Commissioner Surin Thanalertkul, met with Pork Kings, the largest of Thai pork abattoirs and two meat processing plants Vanguard Foods (Thailand) and Betagro Foods to find out more about the rules and practicalities of exporting pork to Thailand, and to determine an approach to gaining wider access for Canadian pork products.
On September 11, the Canadian Food Exporters Association (CFEA) in support of the Embassy organised a half-day Canadian Food Ingredients Seminar at the Four Seasons Hotel.
This seminar and networking session featured presenters from Bartek Ingredients Inc. and FONA International Canada who spoke on malic acid (Bartek) and taste perceptions (FONA) to about 50 people from the Thailand food processing industry.
Bartek, with 20% of the world market for the flavour blending ingredient malic acid, was able to explain the benefits of malic acid in food preparations.
On September 12, Bruce Howard - Counsellor and Trade Commissioner - Regional - ASEAN (Agriculture, Food and Agbiotech), Anderson Blanc and Surin Thanalertkul, Trade Commissioner at Post met with three officials from the Bureau of Disease Control and Veterinary Services at the Department of Livestock Development (DLD) to follow up on the pork export health certificate, the visit of pork establishments by Thai officials to Canada and the current anthrax situation in Canada.
Both companies expressed early satisfaction with the number and quality of leads they had obtained from the show.
Canadian officials visited Vietnam AAFC ADM Andrew Marsland & VP CFIA Krista Mountjoy visited Hanoi from July 16 – 18, 2006 to discuss a number of market access issues with the Vietnamese government.
Food and Hotel Vietnam Exhibition (FHV 2006) Presenting a diverse showcase of the latest food and drink products, equipment, technologies and supplies, FHV 2006 answered the sourcing needs of 7,240 buyers over three days from 27 – 29 September 2006.
Into its 3rd edition this year, FHV 2006 featured over 180 exhibiting companies from 20 countries and eight country/regional group pavilions.
There was total 7,240 visitors to the exhibition.
Vietnamese malting barley mission to Canada A Vietnamese mission of companies in the beer industry went to Canada from June 23 - July 3, 2006 to attend training on Canadian malt & malting barley.
The training was successfully conducted by the Canadian International Grain Institute (CIGI) & Canada Malting Barley Tecnical Centre (CMBTC).
It was aimed at raising the Canadian malting & brewing industry profile and included these topics : barley varieties; barley grading, selection and quality control; Canadian grain marketing and its transportation system and run-off demonstration.
Canadian Barley succeeds in Vietnam Parrish & Heimbecker (http://www.parheim.mb.ca), a Canadian grain dealer, has successfully signed several million dollar contracts with a Vietnamese malting company, Duong Malt Ltd. to export 25,000 tons of Canadian malting barley to Vietnam from this crop year.
Canadian barley has so far been recognized for its high soluble protein, diastatic power and extract level.
This will place much demand for consumer services (e.g., insurance) as well as for natural resources and manufactured goods throughout the region.
Combined imports of wine from these countries last year totalled more than 6.6 million litres - outstripping the 4.3 million litres imported from what has been termed the "Old World".
Latest data from IE Singapore show that only five years ago, wine imports of 3.6 million litres from the New World trailed the 3.8 million litres from the Old World.
Wine imports from New Zealand led the rise - jumping four-fold, followed by Argentina and Chile.
However, with Old World wines being more expensive, the Old World countries continued to lead in the value of wines imported.
They chalked up S$80.5 million last year compared to the New World's S$70 million.
Wine lovers will get to indulge in their passion when vintners come to showcase their wines during the Wine for Asia 2006 exhibition in November.
Singapore now imports from Indonesia after banning Malaysian pork when its hogs were infected with the nipah virus several years ago.
However, Singapore wants to cease importing live animals (its main form of import from Indonesia) since this is costly as the shipment brings along the waste from the live animal transport.
Indonesia has inadequacies in its slaughtering facilities, according to a Philippines official, and this is where the Philippines should have an advantage.
If Singapore approves pork from the Philippines, the result could be an eventual shake-up of the local pork supply scene as Singapore currently relies mainly on fresh/chilled pork from Australia and Indonesia, and frozen pork from China, South America and Canada.
Adapted from Manila Bulletin (September 2006) FOOD INDUSTRY TO BE EXPANDED UNDER IMP3, EMPHASIS ON HALAL FOOD - MALAYSIA The food processing industry will be expanded and diversified towards making Malaysia a regional food production and distribution hub, with particular emphasis on halal products, under the third Industrial Master Plan (IMP3).
The halal industry covers food, non-food products such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, as well as services, including logistics, tourism and marketing.
The report said that to expand Malaysia's food processing industry, the government would also upgrade human resource and technology, enhance R&D, undertake the production and export of highvalue added and niche products, and adopting quality standards.
Three main factors identified to drive the demand for food products are changes in disposable incomes, changes in consumer demand and global trade liberalisation.
The report said growth areas that have been identified are convenience foods, functional foods, food ingredients and related support services.
The report said that there are several challenges that needed to be addressed in order for Malaysia to become a regional food production and distribution hub, such as insufficient supply of raw material, technology and product development, quality and safety and market access.
AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION VIETNAM’S DAIRY SECTOR IN DILEMMA PRIIOR TO WTO ACCESSION Vietnam's dairy cow raising industry is now put in a stalemate as many farmers have felt it necessary to curtail finance for their breeding programs in the wake of the country's forthcoming entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Although fresh milk which is imported currently has to face an import tariff of 20% plus VAT, once Vietnam becomes a WTO member the import tariff will be reduced by half at least, thereafter making domestically produced fresh milk uncompetitive.
Last year, Vietnam's dairy cow supplied processing factories with 198,000 tons of fresh milk compared with some 470,000 tons worth $311 million that was imported.
Since many of the provincially organized, state sponsored or encouraged programs have or are about to go bankrupt for a variety of reasons, most of the local farmers engaged in the field have either had to accept their losses and switch to alternatives or face even greater debt.
Tuyen Quang, one of the 33 provinces and cities nationwide that have been developing dairy cow herds, has recently decided to put an end to its dairy farming program which was prompted in 2002.
Local participating farmers have so far born losses of at least $15 million and are accusing the provincial authorities of bad consideration and short view on anticipated advantages and the economic effectiveness of the originally contemplated scheme.
When the development programs were originally drawn up in 2002, many of the provincial governments, following successes in Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Duong and Long An provinces, encouraged their farmers and local enterprises to buy expensive, imported dairy cows disregarding the long term economic effectiveness or competitiveness of the projects.
A majority of farmers then rushed out to buy imported cows at more than $1,500 each, excluding veterinary medicine and ongoing upkeep costs.
Nguyen Dang Vang, head of the country's Livestock Production Department, said at least 10 out of 33 provinces and cities had stopped developing dairy herds out of fear of accumulating yet further financial losses.
Vang added that some local governments had also been impetuous in requesting local farmers and enterprises to buy dairy cows since they saw the program as a quick fix to improving the standards of living for many poor local farmers.
According to the agriculture ministry's Institute for Agriculture and Rural Development Strategies and Policies, the country's total current herd of about 106,000 dairy cows is valued at between $100-160 million, excluding other ancillary and associated costs and expenses that it estimated to amount to an equivalent sum.
Several observers liken this continuing growth to that of China beginning in the late 1980s and continuing today.
Tourism continues to increase, registering increases in 2005 of 18.4% over 2004, and reached 3.5 million arrivals in 2005.
Tourist arrivals for January and February 2006 were up 15% from year ago levels.
Except for 2003, when SARS was a factor, tourism arrivals since 2000 have increased every year from the year previous, from 2.1 million in 2000 to 3.5 million in 2005.
With consumer spending in Vietnam growing in leaps and bounds, a new momentum has been created for retailers to penetrate and expand their business into an untapped domestic market.
Ho Chi Minh City’s food sector not only has to serve its 6-7 million people and its tourism industry, but also needs to prepare sufficient raw materials for the enterprises that process food for export.
In addition, the sector has to keep some food in reserve for use during natural disasters or other unpredictable need.
As a result of modernization and the city’s development, people are using fewer raw materials to prepare their daily meals and are instead using more packaged ready-to-eat or ready–to-cook food.
Food accounts for 50% of the average person’s monthly expenditures.
The Vietnamese government is also carrying out major programs to increase food production (like rice, tapioca and corn) and enhance food processing technologies, which will require raw inputs.
METRO BUILDS SEVENTH STORE Metro Cash & Carry Vietnam begins work on another Metro wholesale centre in HCMC’s district 12, the third one in the city and the seventh one nationwide.
The US$15-million Metro Hiep Phu wholesale centre covers 5.5 ha and will be completed later this year.
The eight one will be opened in Hanoi next year.
The company says Vietnam is one of the main markets of Metro Cash & Carry besides the Eastern Europe market, and is the strong base for the company expand further in the Asian market in the future.
VISSAN PROCESSES FAST FOOD FOR DOMESTIC MARKET The Vietnam Meat Processing and Import-Export Corp. (VISSAN), is processing fast food and will introduce this new product in October 2006.
Saigon Times Daily, September 18, 2006 SAIGON CO-OP SET TO EXPAND CONVENIENCE STORE CHAIN Vietnam’s leading supermarket chain operator Saigon Co.op opens nine more Co.op convenience stores in HCMC, bringing to 31 the total in the City.
The company has invested VND 30-50 million (US$2000-5000) in each store.
The company expects to get 50 new stores in HCMC this year so that it can increase the figure to 100 late next year.

Indonesia spends US$ 300 millions per year to import soybean.
According to the Indonesian Bureau of Statistic, Indonesia imported 1.1 million tons of soybean in 2005, dropping from 1.2 million tons in 2003.
Indonesia’s Soybean Imports, 2003-2005 DA PLANS TO ESTABLISH PHP 150 MIL BIOTECH LABORATORY Year 2003 2004 2005 Volume (ton) 1,192,717 1,115,792 1,086,178 Value (US$’000) 330,000 416,930 308,009 The Department of Agriculture (DA) is putting up a Php 150-million (C$3.4 million) biotechnology incubator laboratory that will upgrade startup enterprises into small but commercially viable ventures.
This will enable the Philippines to ship out natural ingredient-based plant extracts.
The economically cost-effective business incubator center is harnessing the Philippines' abundant supply of indigenous plants which are natural ingredients for semi-processed products that are also raw materials for other high-valued, exportable products.
A particularly prospective product is the extract from the indigenous olasiman which is known to contain omega 3 fatty acids rich in proteins that were once known only to be found in fish oil.
The government is running after the October season of anato, more popularly known as the achuete, for the opening of the laboratory since the natural coloring ingredient has become an "in" substance.
This is in light of evidences of its being food-safe and a non-carcinogenic dye that will substitute synthetic food colorings that are harmful t human health.
It is estimated that products using natural ingredients have a huge $6 million market in the United States, Japan, Europe, South Korea, and other countries particularly for pharmaceutical uses alone.
Amid a gamut of business opportunities in biotechnology, the incubation center will zero in on the production of plant extracts that have wide applications in food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and industries.
Among the natural ingredients sources are saluyot, malunggay, banaba, and sambong.
Manila Bulletin, 17 September 2006 NESTLE PICKS MALAYSIA AS HALAL HUB With regard to the expansion of soybean plantations, Mr. Mulkan said that the Ministry plans to carry out three programs: growth centre, partnership, and business development.
These programs will basically provide security to production and marketing.
The Ministry is expecting to see the result by 2007 with an increase of soybean plantations to two million hectares.
This presents excellent export opportunities for Canadian dairy product suppliers.
Business Bulletin, 12 Sep 2006
Mr. Mulkan also added that the Ministry of Agriculture projected that Indonesia will be a soybean self-sufficient country in 2010.
Nestle has chosen Malaysia as its global halal food production centre to meet the growing demand for such products.
More than 30% of Nestle (Malaysia) exports are for the Middle East.
A large portion of exports are for the Indonesian market while Singapore and the Philippines, with substantial numbers of Muslims, are also important markets.
The company is in a position to meet the demand for halal food, which will rise in line with the growing global Muslim population of two billion.
Nestle aim to develop Malaysia as the halal hub and a culinary competence centre while countries such as Thailand and Indonesia are strategic regional suppliers of liquid milks, the Philippines of milk powder and breakfast cereals and Singapore of malt extract.
Malaysia is in Nestle’s Asia-Oceania-Africa Zone, is the regional supplier of Kit Kat, Smarties, Milo and cereals.
On average, 70% of Nestle’s products for the Malaysian market are manufactured locally while 30% are imported.
The Edge Financial Daily, 21 August 2006
CAN-SEA Agri-Food Update June-September 2006 AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION REPORT - Food and Hotel Asia 2006, April 25-28, Singapore CANADIAN FIRMS CAN PARTAKE IN MALAYSIA'S FASTGROWING HALAL INDUSTRY With a major portion of their nation's farm income derived from livestock, Canadian firms can form joint ventures to develop Malaysia's fast-growing halal food industry, says Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz.
The Minister of International Trade and Industry told some 300 participants at a seminar here that with Malaysia poised to be halal hub, "it will be good if we can source some raw materials we do not have from Canada."
She said "raw materials from Canada can be used to produce halal products and certify them as halal by using our standards and then market it globally from Malaysia."
Australia and New Zealand were two main suppliers of halal beef for Malaysia.
Besides being a promoted sector in Malaysia, there was a huge market for halal products globally, she said.
Malaysia's potential as a halal hub was primarily due to it being a Muslim country while the country has been the front runner in promoting the halal sector by incorporating domestic and international Halal Standards as well as producing Halal products by using various technologies.
She said this when responding to a question on Malaysia's competitive position in becoming a halal hub and on the upcoming World Halal Forum in Kuala Lumpur at a seminar on "Business Opportunities in Malaysia," Thursday.
Rafidah is leading a trade and investment mission to Canada comprising 49 representatives from the private sector, MITI, Malaysia Industrial Development Authority, Malaysia External Trade Development Corp, the state governments of Penang, Perak, Kedah, Sabah and Selangor as well as Multimedia Development Corp Malaysia.
She said the department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) has been authorised to produce the halal logo and give it a global recognition.
JAKIM has set the necessary Halal standards that need to be followed by halal food and services providers.
The United Nations has accepted the certification by JAKIM for halal products.
"We are now in the process of getting other agencies aboard, such as from Canada and if possible an Islamic Authority from here that can help to become a correspondent certification authority later on for some products that we source from Canada," she said.
Currently, Malaysia is marketing its halal standards globally, especially to Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) countries, she said.
The upcoming World Halal Forum aims to bring together people who produce and supply products and services that are halal and also exchange ideas on ways to market halal products.
Industry estimates put the global halal market at between halfa-trillion to US$2.5 trillion annually.
Rafidah also explained that the process of producing Halal products does not stop at slaughtering livestock according to Islamic procedures but includes hygienic practices and products used in the process of producing the goods and services.
The minister said investments in the halal sector, especially in the Eastern Corridor in states like Kelantan, Terengganu, Northern Johor, Pahang, Sabah and Sarawak would enjoy more tax holidays compared with other states in the country.
"The value of tax incentives in the Eastern Corridor is higher than elsewhere as we like to divert some of our manufacturing to less developed states, away from the central regions of Malaysia to enable them to benefit from the country's industrialisation.
"We encourage investors to go there.
If you get 70 percent tax exemption here (in the central region), then its 100 percent there (in the Eastern Corridor)," she said.
SE Asia Trade Commissioners were very active in introducing their buyers to our companies.
At least 3 Canadian firms exhibited elsewhere in the Show and at least 2 others were "walking the Show".
A record number of exhibitors, and probably visitors, proved that FHA is the show to be at in Asia.
We purchased space in each of the Show Dailies (Show newspaper) to highlight Canadian products, and this included an editorial write-up.
Exhibitors completed evaluation forms and all commented favourably on the show, the Canadian presence and the leads generated.
Agri-food Trade Commissioners and Trade Commissioner Assistants from the eight countries in SE Asia [Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia (2), Philippines (2), Singapore (3), Thailand, and Vietnam (2)] attended and were key to introducing Canadian companies to potential buyers they might not otherwise have met.
FOOD AND HOTEL ASIA 2008 - RECRUITMENT It is not too early to start thinking about your participation in the FHA2008.
Stay tuned to this newsletter for details as to how your export marketing efforts to SE Asia can be enhanced as part of the federally-sponsored Canadian Pavilion.
Thank you very much for organizing one of the most successful Singapore shows on record.
The welcome kits, the Canada booklets and the advertising in the show dailies certainly helped present a very positive image for Canada and the exhibitors.
It is too early to say with certainty, but I am confident that (we) will return in 2008."
"Food and Hotel Asia is one of the premier food shows in the world and provides broad Asian regional exposure.
It provides an excellent opportunity to meet with key Asian food buyers from countries such as India, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and Korea.
I would recommend this show as an excellent opportunity to introduce Canadian food products not just in Singapore but throughout Asia in one single event.
The show is in same class as Anuga or Sial."
"It was very much my, and CanGro's pleasure to be part of the Canadian presence at the FHA Show last month.
I received many leads to follow; and I gained some very good insights into a wide range of markets, suppliers, and products that we would never be exposed to over here.
This was a MUCH better show than 2004 for volume, variety, and quality of international Buyers ... this might be a function of improved economies over there.
And finally, I would comment that your team did a FANTASTIC job with organizing everything, and being on hand to help all the time.
And the Pavilion was much, much improved …all in all, a great improvement over the last few shows."
CAN-SEA Agri-Food Update A quarterly newsletter presented by Canada’s agri-food team in South East Asia This newsletter is available in English & French at the Agri-food Trade Service Website : www.ats.agr.gc.ca
Our team of Canadian Agri-Food Trade Commissioners in SE Asia is very pleased to provide you with our second edition of this quarterly newsletter highlighting our work finding opportunities for Canadian agri-food businesses in the 8 markets we serve.
A major development in the Region is the access of Vietnam to the World Trade Organization in January, 2007.
This brings this important trading partner under the umbrella of the rules-based trading organization, and will provide certain benefits to Canada in the areas of canola (oil, seed and meal), feed peas, wines and icewines.
Improvements in duties for pork and beef products and feed ingredients were also achieved in the accession negotiations.
Sometimes product is not available, but a response is still good business practice, as it also encourages future business when the potential customer enquires again when product may be available.
Please take a look at the material inside.
Our team reports on the successes of several companies, and you will note that the Region is certainly dynamic in scope.

Spotlight on
SINGAPORE
Some conclusions for Canada from this scenario:
• Singapore is ASEAN's most developed nation, with a well-developed consumer market underpinned by sophisticated middle and upper income groups.
Singapore currently has a population of about 4.2 million people.
Population growth is slow and is being supplemented by immigration.
The population is expected to grow to 5 million people by 2010.
Although young in profile, Singapore now has an ageing population.
23% of Singaporeans are aged 19 or younger and will be an important element of the consumer market in future.
The economy remains strongly growth oriented, but middle income consumer confidence is undermined by fears over job losses, which are a relatively new phenomenon in Singapore.
Over 8 million visitors arrive in Singapore every year, confirming Singapore’s reputation as a Regional transportation hub.
The food supply chain is modern and well developed with most food products now being purchased at supermarkets.
Culturally, wet markets still have some importance for those people who like to buy their fresh produce at these venues.
This situation has developed since the mid-1980s.
Singapore's economy is based on its prowess as a base for manufacturing industries and as a financial centre, but Singapore is facing problems arising from being a higher cost manufacturing base than other countries, e.g. China and Malaysia.
The Singapore government is in the process of restructuring the economic development focus in order to establish more jobs for its citizens and continued economic growth and prosperity in future.
Economic commentators forecast that Singapore should see positive economic development over the next 5 years under circumstances where there are no major shocks to the global economy.
When taken together under the developing ASEAN Free Trade Area and their longstanding historical links, Singapore, Brunei and neighbouring Malaysia can form the core of ASEAN's higher income group consumer market in future.
Under circumstances of positive economic development, by 2015, the middle and upper income consumers in these three countries could number up to 30 million people, a target market of similar size to Canada today.
Singapore and Brunei will continue to have strong demand for imported agri-food products and processed food and beverages.
Brunei's demand will continue to be supported by re-export trade from Singapore and, to a lesser extent, Malaysia.
The trend towards diet modernization that is fully evident in Singapore and Brunei today will increase demand for temperate climate commodities and food ingredients, e.g. wheat, feed materials, but the industries that use these products will probably not been based in Singapore or Brunei in the longer term.
AFTA, and the already well-established links with Malaysia, are likely to see both countries become even more reliant on Malaysian-based industries (probably owned by Singapore and Brunei businesses) for a broader range of foodstuffs than today.
This is already starting to happen in some industries, e.g. wheat flour, bread, dry noodles and, to a lesser extent, beer (though not Brunei) and some frozen foods.
SINGAPORE – PORK PRICES MAY RISE BY UP TO 20% The price of pork, which has been rising steadily over the past year, could jump because of a drought in one of Singapore's biggest suppliers, Australia.
But for now, retailers said they intend to absorb the price hike.
Supermarket chain FairPrice said it would hold the price of its chilled pork steady for as long as possible.
Current shelf prices range from $7 per kg of lean meat to about $15 for a kg of ribs.
Between January and October this year, more than 69,000 tonnes of pork were consumed here.
The drought has taken a toll on crops over the past year, with shortages causing September grain prices to skyrocket.
The APL spokesman added that wheat prices rose from A$14 (S$17) per tonne to A$242.
AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION - SINGAPORE SINGAPORE – ORGANIC FOOD BOOM BOOSTING SALES Sunny Singapore seems to be in the midst of an organic food craze.
The strong appetite for organic food - thanks to the growing number of wellness-minded consumers here and concerns over food safety - is seeing companies involved in natural eatables chewing on big-time success.
Among them is Cold Storage which opened the island's first organic supermarket, Naturally Marketplace, at VivoCity last year.
Naturally Marketplace offers nearly 1,000 organic product lines, ranging from milk to wines to cleaning aids.
Organic food in Cold storage has been enjoying steady, double-digit growth.
Historically, demand for organic products came mostly from the large Western expatriate communities, but recently, the demand for organic foods has expanded to include locals.
Health consultant Sim Nget Seer of Biogenic International told BT that demand is definitely growing 'judging by the number of organic retail outlets that have sprouted up recently'.
Ms Sim also felt that local consumers are becoming more health conscious, and this is partly a result of the increased number of healthcare talks which have raised their awareness about healthy diet.
According to Britain's Organic Monitor, the estimated retail sales for Singapore organic food market stood at about US$40 million last year.
Across Asia, the market size is set to hit close to US$1 billion this year, it added.
This is not surprising given the numerous articles of food safety crisis that consumers are bombarded with almost daily - including contaminated fish, listeria in ice, the bird flu (H5NI) virus and high levels of pesticides found in vegetables.

PRIMA OFFERS A TASTE OF SINGAPORE IN VANCOUVER FRANCHISING is Prima's launchpad for spreading its wings overseas - and Canada is a natural stop for the flour-based food group.
'Vancouver (on Canada's west coast) is a cosmopolitan city and there is growing interest among mainstream Canadians in pan-Asian cuisine,' says Lewis Cheng, general manager of Prima Food, the food manufacturing, licensing and franchising arm of the group.
He says the group's Prima Taste restaurants serve authentic Singapore food like laksa, prawn mee, mee siam and Hainanese chicken rice.
They constitute a unique version of pan-Asian cuisine as the food has evolved over the years 'through a confluence of the various culinary traditions and styles of our major races'.
'We believe that Canada's resident population would therefore be receptive to a pan-Asian restaurant concept like the Prima Taste restaurant,' Mr Cheng says.
Through a franchise agreement, Prima opened its first Canadian Prima Taste 'True Singapore Cuisine' concept restaurant in early October.
The Canadian franchisee is committed to open at least 10 Prima Taste restaurants in the country within the next five years.
Launched last year, the Prima Taste 'True Singapore Cuisine' restaurant franchise already has outlets in major cities like Vancouver, Shanghai and Beijing.
There are also restaurants in San Jose, in the United States; Jakarta and Bandung, in Indonesia, and Manila, in the Philippines.
'The next franchised outlets will be opening in Surabaya (Indonesia), Hangzhou (China), Taipei (Taiwan) and Colombo (Sri Lanka),' Mr Cheng discloses.
'The Prima Taste brand's mission is to serve authentic Singapore cuisine in the world,' he says.
'And we believe that through franchising, we will be able to work with local partners for the various target markets for optimum growth and results.'
Thanks to the franchise system, Mr Cheng says, Prima is on track to build a chain of Singapore restaurants around the world.
'Each restaurant will serve a wide variety of authentic Singapore cuisine that is consistently delicious anywhere in the world, providing a uniquely Singapore dining experience.'
Venturing into Canada is not without its problems.
'Because Canada is in a different time zone, operational support becomes more challenging and costly,' Mr Cheng says.
'In terms of regulatory requirements, we need to comply with their disclosure laws which can be tedious and costly.'
While there are restaurants in Canada which serve Malaysian, Thai and EastWest fusion food, he says there is no restaurant offering genuine Singapore food in Vancouver.
'This would provide for quality assurance and minimise any potential conflict, delays and miscommunication.'

AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION INDONESIAN LIVESTOCK FOOD INDUSTRIES SUFFER FROM MEAT BONE MEAL SHORTAGE The Indonesian poultry food industries are suffering from meat bone meal shortage as the import of the product is disrupted by rumour about illegal meat bone meal.
The Chairperson of the Association of Livestock Food Companies (GPMT) Budiarto Subijanto reveals that MBM stocks at companies' warehouses are diminishing, while the imported MBM at ports are hard to release.
"It has been a month Importers cannot release their MBM from ports since the Department of Agriculture has not given their permission," he informed yesterday.
To release MBM from ports, he continued, importers had to have Letter of Request for Livestock Food Import.
At the moment, thousands of containers of MBM are piling at ports as the Minister of Agriculture has yet signed a single letter of request.
"The Minister of Agriculture reasons that the Directorate General of Animal Husbandry has yet made any recommendation.
However, we have not been able to contact the Director General of Animal Husbandry [Mathur Riady] as he is going abroad at the moment," added Budiarto.
According to him, the imported MBM piling at ports had met the necessary requirements, such as bill of lading (B/L) import document, invoice, certificate of origin, and certificate of animal health.
He stated that the MBM products were imported from countries free from the food-and-mouth disease, such as New Zealand and Australia.
Outside of facing MBM or raw material shortage, livestock food industries also suffer from losses on the requirement to pay for US$15-US$30 per day per container in demorage fee (fine imposed on delays in getting imported goods from ports).
"A company has to spend IDR1.38 million-IDR2.7 million per container for 10 days in delay or around IDR4 million-IDR12 million per container per month," complained Budiarto.
Separately, Marketing Director of PT Sierad Produce Albert Sitorus disclosed that the company had to spend US$20 per container per day in demurrage fee since three weeks ago.
"As a result, we are forced to reduce our losses by burdening the additional costs to the customers [animal breeders]," said Albert.
According to him, if the MBM could not be released from ports, the livestock food companies would be forced to use poultry meat meals.As a consequence, inserted Albert, the prices of livestock food would soar as the use of poultry meat meals increase production costs up by IDR30,000 per kilogram.
The loan, supported by an additional 10 mln usd from the Vietnamese government, will fund research and training, new laboratory equipment in some institutes and education and information services for farmers in remote regions, the ADB said.
The communist country, which was a net rice importer in the late 1980s, is now the world's number two exporter of rice and coffee, and a major international supplier of tea, cashew nuts and rubber.
"Access to new technologies by farmers and agrobased enterprises is essential as Vietnam's agriculture is gradually shifting its focus from increased production volumes to increased production values," the ADB said.

MATERIAL IMPORTS HINDERING DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMAL FEED PROCESSORS Dependence on imported materials is laying heavy pressure on the Vietnamese animal feed processing sector, hindering it from gaining stable development and increasing competitiveness, according to the Association of Animal Feed under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
At present, import materials accounted for more than 54.6% of the sector’s total production value, equaling to VND9,300 billion for processing.
Vietnam in the past ten months of this year spent $671 million importing animal feed and materials for processing, an on-year rise of 30%.
AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION BID TO WIN OVER FUSSY BEEF BUYERS THE importance Asian consumers place on food taste and quality can be seen in the way meat is promoted and presented in supermarkets throughout Taiwan, Singapore and Japan.
Details on how the beef is produced features strongly on packaging, along with enticing messages about health benefits and taste.
The information is delivered to consumers via branding, with nearly all meat in Asian stores sold under a brand heavily promoted with stickers, posters and glossy brochures.
Common themes include "naturally fresh", "delicious and tasty", or "tender and succulent".
This is in stark contrast to Australian supermarkets, where most red meat is sold generically without brand names or detailed consumer information.
It is estimated that in Japan alone there are at least 200 different beef brands.
Every food imaginable in Japanese supermarkets appears to be branded and priced accordingly.
For example, one shop had a display of tomatoes that looked the same.
Depending on the brand, some were twice as expensive and shoppers were buying them.
Meat and Livestock Australia Japan manager Samantha Jamieson said the importance of product branding and image could not be underestimated in that market.
"Branding is so powerful in Japan," Ms Jamieson said.
Part of MLA's work in Asia is helping to develop and support meat brands promoted by Australian exporters or producer groups.
MLA southeast Asia and China regional manager Tim Kelf said the importance of branding in countries such as Taiwan and Singapore was slightly different to Japan, where the culture was image driven.
He said South-East Asian branding aimed at building customer loyalty and creating a product that had more value to retailers than just price.
In places such as Singapore, Australian beef had to compete against low-priced meat from Brazil or Indian buffalo.
Mr Kelf, who has worked in Asia for more than 20 years, said Australia couldn't compete at the lower end of the market on price so they worked to create relationships with higher-end retailers.
"In the mid 1980s, when Brazilian beef was allowed into Singapore, we went from selling 15,000 tonnes to 2500 tonnes the next year," he said.
"That's what happens when these guys come to town.
We lose the bottom end of the market because we can't compete.
That's why a lot of the work we do is based around brands and building customer loyalty."
VIETNAM’S LIVESTOCK SECTOR UNDER VARIOUS THREATS High feed prices, rampant pandemics, unplanned production and weak food hygiene and safety are threatening Vietnam's livestock production sector, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
The ministry's Livestock Production Department's (LPD) statistics show the price for 100 kilos of swine feed is $29.5 in Vietnam while it is $25.5 in Poland and Netherlands, $31 in China, $23 in Brazil, $19 in Canada and only $17.5 in the US.
The department also said that while the price level of pork in Vietnam is $0.80-$0.90 per kilo, the price level is $0.70-$0.80 per kilo in other countries in the region.
An employee of Metro Cash & Carry wholesale centre in Hanoi said the store had sold imported food since its opening in mid 2003 and had developed a customer base.
"Local people are quick to change their taste to foreign food, which is widely believed to ensure food hygiene and safety," he said.
While the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) shows concern over food hygiene and safety in all sectors, especially agricultural, local farmers seem to ignore this problem.
Experts warned that chicken and pork from Thailand and China will be imported into Vietnam in greater volumes post WTO entry because of geographical proximity.

AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION MALAYSIA - CAPTURING THE GLOBAL HALAL FOOD MARKET The Malaysian operations of the world's biggest food company are poised to play a leading role as Nestlé targets the fastgrowing halal food business.
Nestlé's current sales of halal products is in the region of US$5 billion to US$6 billion per annum.
Demand from consumers and sales of these food products should jump further as more Muslim governments take initiatives to encourage private sector participation in expanding the halal food business.
In the case of Malaysia, it has initiated an ambitious plan to turn the country into the world's premier halal hub.
At the same time, the international Muslim community is getting nearer in standardising and harmonising matters pertaining to halal manufacturing practices, certification and labelling of products.
Once the consolidation of these various certifications into one globally accepted halal standard and logo is achieved, the halal food trade is expected to grow exponentially.
Nestlé's halal-certified factories produce a range of products, including coffee and other beverages, culinary sauces and seasonings, noodles, breakfast cereals, shelf-stable dairy and non-dairy creamers, sweetened condensed milk, infant nutrition, confectionery, ice cream and performance nutrition.

VIETNAM’S WTO ENTRY OPENS DOORS TO FOREIGN MEAT More different kinds of foreign meat will be available in Vietnam in the post-WTO period, bringing more choices to Vietnamese housewives.
However, domestic chicken will be favored thanks to local customers' habits.
Director of a trading company in Ho Chi Minh City (HCM City) said that with the committed tax rates, chicken wings and legs will be imported to Vietnam which are 'soft' in prices.
Phu An Sinh Company's Director Pham Van Minh also said that there will be more and more foreign-made products, adding that imported chicken will be suitable for fast food.
However, Mr Minh said Vietnamese consumers will still favor domestic chicken, bred by households on a small scale.
Besides, Vietnamese consumers like buying chickens whole, while most foreign-sourced chickens are without heads.
"I'm planning to set up a new business, which will specialize in exporting chicken breasts and providing chicken legs and wings to fast food restaurants," Mr Minh said, adding that many fast food shops, like US based KFC in HCM City, will profusely consume the chicken material supply.
The 0% tax rate to be applied soon after Vietnam joins the WTO will help investors save investment expenses, which will lead to lower prices on different poultry meats in the time to come.
Meanwhile, analysts said foreign beef also could not overwhelm Vietnamese market after the country joins WTO because of its high prices.
Dinh Quoc Phong, a staff member of Metro, the biggest retailer in Vietnam, said that meat prices will decrease as a result of a profuse supply on the market.
However, foreign-sourced beef will be much higher than locally-made products, leaving locally made products the main choices of Vietnamese consumers.
Makro issued a statement saying its owners, the Netherlands-based SHV Holdings NV and other shareholders, had signed an agreement with Tesco Malaysia to sell its entire operations in Malaysia, which include a network of eight stores.

FOOD PRODUCTS MEAD JOHNSON EXPANDING - Thailand vies to win B4bn plant Thailand is among five countries Mead Johnson is considering for a new four-billion-baht powdered milk plant.
The plant, to be Asia's largest, would help support future growth in the region, according to Stephen Golsby, president of Mead Johnson Nutritionals.
Mr Golsby, who was in Bangkok yesterday, declined to identify the other countries, but said a decision on the investment would be made within the next six to 12 months.
Mead, the world's largest child nutrition manufacturer, would consider labour costs, infrastructure, domestic market demand and investment privileges in choosing a location.
The company operates powdered milk plants in the US, Mexico, Netherlands, China, the Philippines and Thailand.
About half of the Thai plant's production is sold locally, with the rest exported to Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
Mr Golsby said the company will invest more in Asia because it is the fastest growing region worldwide, with double-digit growth over the past several years.
Asia accounts for one-third of the company's global sales.
Thailand offered strong benefits, including a talented workforce, a competitive cost base and a favourable geographic location within the region, although transportation remained a weakness.
Mead Johnson will also officially open its new powdered milk line at its existing Chon Buri facility within the next several months.
The new facility will help increase its total capacity of powdered milk by 25%, including its Alacta-NF brand.

THAILAND MOAC TO SET UP PIG BOARD TO TACKLE PORK PRICE PROBLEM Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), Yukol Limlamthong revealed that the ministry is expediting the establishment of Pig Board or the committee for swine and pork products development.
The Pig Board, which will be chaired by the MOAC Minister Thira Sutabutr, aims to resolve the problem of low pork prices.
The ministry speculates that the decrease on pork prices has caused in part by avian influenza.
During 2006, the pandemic has prompted farmers to raise swine instead of chicken, resulting in too much pork supply in the market.
As for a long-term solution, Mr Yukol said the ministry has cooperated with the Department of Internal Trade to help farmers sell pork and control swine breeding.

VIETNAM - After a lot of effort in working with the Vietnamese Department of Animal Health, post successfully assisted CFIA in obtaining the animal health certificates regarding export of avian, porcine and fish meat and bone meal as well as feather meal from Canada to Vietnam.
These certificates have become effective since October 25, 2006.
VIETNAM - Post also assisted CFIA in removing the new trade barrier from the Vietnamese government that requires DNA testing on imported meat & bone meal products to look for MBM contamination with ruminant material.
That being said all the above Canadian animal health certificates on export of meat & bone meal products to Vietnam remain unchanged for usage and there is no further requirements applied to Canada.
VIETNAM - After getting feedback from Metro Cash and Carry in Vietnam that McCain regional office in Malaysia did not respond to their enquiry, Bruce Howard and HOCHI Post recommended Metro deal directly with McCain HQ in Canada.
The firm, in collaboration with Sacammas Sdn Bhd, a leading local distributing company for scientific and chemical products and services, will be engaged in a project to analyse existing incentive programs and formulate new ones.
The contract signing ceremony for the New Agricultural and Agribusiness Incentive Programs for Brunei Darussalam project took place at the Department of Agriculture headquarters.
Signing on behalf of the Agriculture department was its acting director, Normah Suria Hayati PJDSMDSU Dr Awang Mohd Jamil al-Sufri, while the Canadian-based company was represented by its Project Manager, Neal Carter.
Present to witness the signing was the Acting Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Industry and Primary Resources, Pg Mariana PDNLDR Pg Abdul Momin.
Carter pointed out that the ever-changing global market for agri-and food-products, as well as the low self-sufficiency of the domestic agriculture sector, necessitated the assessment of existing incentive programs.
He also said that the programs had not taken into consideration human resource requirements, impact on quality of life and eventual self-reliance.
In addition, analyses of the department's programs would help identify and develop niche export-oriented products such as halal products, which the project manager recognised as one of the sultanate's focal strategies in promoting the economy.
The Agriculture Department hopes that the project would evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and appropriateness of its current programs to meet national and the department's objectives, and to formulate new incentive programs.
The current programs were designed to enhance the agrobased processing sector, to attract more private sector involvement in agribusiness and in general to meet the country's economic diversification goal.
Agrodev has conducted several projects for the Department of Agriculture since 1998, the latest of which was completed in 2004.
The project, which will be carried out in three phases, is expected to be initiated this month and completed by June 2007 with the handing over of the final report.
